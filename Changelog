	** address6 as host definition attribute (to be used dual stacked, address stays default!)
	** host macro $HOSTADDRESS6$ for e.g. check-host-alive
	** if not set, host name is set as default (same behaviour as address)
	** shown in classic ui only if set (not matching host name)
	** idoutils mysql/postgresql/oracle hosts config table gets new column 'address6' populated
	** note: as of this release, idoutils depends hard on include/objects.h of icinga core. internal idomod api changed, new datatype added.

* install: add sysconfig source to init script #1015

* idoutils: do not clear host|service|scheduleddowntime status tables on core restart/reload (inspired by Opsview) #1106 #1176
* idoutils: only insert service and host checks when they are finally processed, increase performance by replacing insert/update with single insert (idea by Opsview/Opsera Ltd with mysql and servicechecks) #1100
	** servicechecks table is heavily used next to hostchecks
	**- if the core does a host|service check, there are 3 situations the event broker will get data: INITIATE, ASYNC_PRECHECK, PROCESSED
	** idomod/ido2db process INITIATE (insert) and PROCESSED (update) til now
	** now, ido2db takes only PROCESSED with a full insert, mysql and postgres use sql standard insert, oracle a prepared statement with insert
	** reduced number of check events sent to IDOUtils by 66%
	** reduced number of fired SQL statements by 50%
	** changed 1 SQL statement for each rdbms, making it smaller and saving index lookup (and virtual table by merge in oracle)
	** index savings, and dropped unique keys - check upgrade sql scripts for mysql/postgresql/oracle
* idoutils: add indexes for logentries, preventing heavy load #1055
* idoutils: enable max_logentries_age & max_acknowledgements_age with 31 days for cleaning by default in ido2db.cfg #1155

1.0.2 - 06/30/2010

ENHANCEMENTS
* core: init script shows config errors option; don't remove pidfile if icinga did not stop in a timely manner
* core: check if icinga running before starting; if died remove lockfile first
* core: add in sync retention facility (Ton Voon, Opsera Ltd)
* core: add new is_volatile setting of 2 for services, which respects the re-notification interval for notifications (Ton Voon)
* core: add Icinga option -S functions much like -s but will dump the entire scheduling queue is it would run,
        in addition to providing the summary data (Steven (Steven D. Morrey)
* core: icinga can send log messages to syslogd using a local facility instead of the default one
* core: enhanced diagnostic output when a regular expression fails to compile (Max Schubert)
* core: add state-based escalation ranges (Mark Gius)
        The directives first_notification and last_notification apply to the
        total count of notifications on a particular service or host.  It is
        sometimes desirable to escalate after the Nth critical notification,
        rather than after a total number of N notifications have been sent.
	NOTE: This can be enabled through configure, it is currently incompaitble with mk_livestatus!

	service_check_timeout seconds.
	c - Critical (default)
	u - Unknown
	w - Warning
	o - OK

* core: add escalation_condition definition (Vitali Voroth DECOIT GmbH)
	The escalation_condition option is completely optional and can be
	defined for host escalations as well as for service escalations.
	escalation_condition <condition> ( [ & / | ] <condition> )*
	where <condition> is either host hostname = [u,d,o] or
	service hostname.service_description] = [w,u,c,o].
	The escalation_condition accepts a list of one or more conditions
	separated by & (logical AND) or | (logical OR).
	w = WARNING
	u = UNKNOWN
	c = CRITICAL
	o = OK for services or UP for hosts
	d = DOWN for hosts

* idoutils: add ido2db threaded housekeeper

		- dynamic binded procedure for DELETE on table by instance_id called at startup
		  for cleaning config/status
		- dynamic binded procedure for DELETE on tably by instance_id, field<time called
		  during periodic cleanup in threaded housekeeper
		- all other queries are prepared with their own statement handler
			 4x DELETE
			 52x MERGE
			 9x INSERT
			 9x UPDATE
			 5x SELECT
	- rewritten getting cached object_id using select
	- all queries use binded unixtimestamp instead of prepared query string
	- removed autoincrement sequence and insert triggers to update primary key
	- added sequence for each table
	- INSERT INTO ... (id, ...) VALUES (seq_name.nextval, ...) will do the trick
	- added RETURNING id INTO :id for INSERT statements to save one round trip
	- MERGE does not support returning INTO, added SELECT seq_name.currval query instead
	  for fetching last inserted id
	- add explizit upgrade information and provided procedure to alter sequence start
	  when importing data (check oracle-upgrade-1.0.1.sql for more info)

3.0a1 - 03/06/2007
------------------
Here are all the changes since Nagios 2.x:

* Adaptive monitoring:
     - Check timeperiod can now be modified on-the-fly

* Notification changes:
     - Added first_notification_delay to host and object definitions to delay first notification
     - Notifications are now sent out when flap detection is disabled on a host/service-specific
       or program-wide basis ($NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro = "FLAPPINGDISABLED")
     - Notifications can now be sent out when scheduled downtime starts, ends, and is cancelled.  The
       $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro will be set to "DOWNTIMESTART", "DOWNTIMEEND", or "DOWNTIMECANCELLED",
       respectively.  In order to receive downtime notifications, specify 's' or 'downtime' in contact, host,
       and/or service notification options.

* Object changes: 
     - Added ability to use multiple template names (separated by commas) in object definitions
     - Added ability to null out optional character directives in object definitions (using 'null' without quotes)
     - Added hostg/service/contactgroup_members directives to host/service/contactgroup definitions,
       respectively, for allowing including host, service, or contact members from "sub" groups.
     - Added support for custom variables in host, service, and contact definitions
     - Added host_notifications_enabled, service_notifications_enabled, can_submit_commands to contact definitions
     - Added optional display_name directive to host and service definitions
     - Removed serviceextinfo definitions and merged variables with service definitions
     - Removed hostextinfo definitions and merged variables with host definitions
     - Services inherit contactgroups, notification interval, and notification period from associated host if not specified
     - Service escalations inherit contactgroups, notification interval, and escalation period from associated service if not specified
     - Host escalations inherit contactgroups, notification interval, and escalation period from associated host if not specified
     - Host, service, host escalation, and service escalation definitions now support a 'contacts' directive, along with 'contact_groups'
     - Service dependencies with blank dependent host/hostgroup names will create "same host" dependencies


* Performance optimizations:
     - Added ability to precache object config files
     - Added ability to exclude object relationship and circular path
       checks from verification process

* Check output:
     - Multiline output support for host and service checks

* Macro changes:
     - Added $LONGHOSTOUTPUT$ and $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$ macros
     - Added $TEMPPATH$ macro
     - Removed $COMMENTDATAFILE$ and $DOWNTIMEDATAFILE$ macros
     - Added $HOSTDISPLAYNAME$ and $SERVICEDISPLAYNAME$ macros
     - Custom host/service/contact macros accessible via $_HOST<varname>$, $_SERVICE<varname>, or $_CONTACT<varname>$.
       On-demand host/service macros for custom vars are working.  Custom vars are also set as environment vars.
     - On-demand service macros can contain and empty host name field.  In this case, the name of the current host will be used.
     - $HOSTNOTES$ and $SERVICENOTES$ macros may now contain macros themselves

* Flapping changes:
     - Added flap_detection_options directive to host and service definitions to control which
       states (i.e. OK, WARNING, UNKNOWN, and/or CRITICAL) are used in flap detection logic
     - Percent state change and state history are now retained and recorded even when host/service
       flap detection is disabled.
     - Hosts and services are immediately check for flapping when flap detection is enabled program-wide.
     - Hosts/services that are flapping when flap detection is disabled program-wide are now logged

* External command changes:
     - Added PROCESS_FILE external command to allow processing of external commands found in
       an external (regular) file.  Very useful for passive checks with long output or scripting.
     - Custom commands can now be submitted to Nagios.  Custom command names are prefixed with an underscore
       and are not processed internally by the Nagios daemon.  They may, however, be processed by NEB modules.
     - External commands are now checked by default.  Nagios 2.x and earlier did not check for external commands
       by default.

* Status data changes:
     - Contact status information is now saved (although it is not processed by the old CGIs)

* Retention data changes:
     - Contact status information is now retained across program restarts
     - Comment and downtime IDs are now stored across program restarts, should be unique unless reset
     - Added retained_host/service_attribute_mask variables to control what host/service attribs are retained globally
     - Added retained_process_host/service_attribute_mask variables to control what process attribs are retained
     - Added retained_contact_host/service_attribute_mask variables to control what contact attribs are retained globally

* Comment changes:
     - Comments are now stored in the status and retention files
     - Non-persistent acknowledgement comments are now deleted when the acknowledgement is removed (instead of when Nagios restarts)

* Host check logic changes:
     - Most host checks are now run asynchronously, in parallel!
     - Scheduled host checks now help improve performance, instead of hinder it (if caching is enabled)
     - Added cached_host_check_horizon option for enabling use of cached host check results
     - Added enable_predictive_host_dependency_checks for enabling predictive checks of dependent hosts
     - Added retry_interval to host definitions
     - Added check_for_orphaned_hosts option and support for orphaned host checks
     - Passive host check states can now be translated from their original DOWN/UNREACHABLE state if the
       new translate_passive_host_results option is enabled

* Service check logic changes:
     - 'parallelize' option in service definitions deprecated/no longer used
     - Added cached_service_check_horizon option for enabling use of cached service check results
     - Added enable_predictive_service_dependency_checks for enabling predictive checks of dependent services

* Dependency changes:
     - Host and service dependencies can now have a timeperiod during which they're valid (dependency_period directive)

* Event broker changes:
     - Updated NEB API version
     - Modified adaptive program status callback
     - Added adaptive contact status callback
     - Added host/service precheck callbacks to allow modules to cancel/override internal host/service checks

* Embedded Perl changes:
     - Added 'enable_embedded_perl' option to main config file to control whether epn is enabled/disabled
     - Added support for perl plugins to specify whether or not they should be run under the epn...  The
       second to tenth line of a perl plugin may start with '# nagios: +epn' or '# nagios: -epn' to explicity indicate that it
       should be run under the epn.
     - Added 'use_embedded_perl_implicitly' option to main config file to determine whether or not perl
       plugins will use the epn if they don't explicitly allow/disalow it

* CGI changes:
     - Hostgroup and servicegroup summaries now show important/unimportant problem breakdowns like the TAC CGI
     - Minor layout changes to host and service detail views in extinfo CGI

* Misc changes:
     - More information given when testing scheduling (-s command line option)
     - Removed fixed length restrictions for host names and service descriptions
     - Plugin output length restriction bumped up to 4K
     - Added temp_path directive to main config file for specifying temp directory
     - Multiline output support for system commands via my_system()
     - Added global event_id and notification_id vars that are at least unique during a single run of Nagios
     - Default is now to check for orphaned services, rather than not
     - Renamed service_reaper_frequency to check_result_reaper_frequency
     - Fractional notification and check intervals are now supported (e.g. "3.5" minutes)
     - Backslash chars are now used to escape command arguments that contain \ or ! characters
     - Added 'external_command_buffer_slots' and 'check_result_buffer_slots' variables to specify size of internal buffers
