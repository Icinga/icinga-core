#################################################################


# MAIN CONFIGURATION FILE
# This tells the CGIs where to find your main configuration file.
# The CGIs will read the main and host config files for any other
# data they might need.

main_config_file=@sysconfdir@/icinga.cfg


# ATTRIBUTE BASED AUTHORIZATION FILE
# This option will include a file defining authroization based on
# attributes.

#authorization_config_file=@sysconfdir@/cgiauth.cfg


# PHYSICAL HTML PATH
# This is the path where the HTML files for Icinga reside.  This
# value is used to locate the logo images needed by the statusmap
# and status CGIs.

physical_html_path=@datadir@



# URL HTML PATH
# This is the path portion of the URL that corresponds to the
# physical location of the Icinga HTML files (as defined above).
# This value is used by the CGIs to locate the online documentation
# and graphics.  If you access the Icinga pages with an URL like
# http://www.myhost.com/icinga, this value should be '/icinga'
# (without the quotes).

url_html_path=@htmurl@



# URL STYLESHEETS PATH
# This option allows to define an url stylesheet path other than the
# default ($url_html_path/stylesheets). This will be useful when
# adding custom stylesheets in another location.
# If not set, the default location will be used.

url_stylesheets_path=@htmurl@/stylesheets



# HTTP CHARSET
# This defines charset that is sent with HTTP headers.

http_charset=utf-8



# HIGHLIGHT TABLE ROWS
# This option allows you to define if table rows in status.cgi
# will be highlighted or not.
# Values: 0 = disables row highlighting
#	  1 = enables row highlighting

highlight_table_rows=1



# PENDING STATES OPTION
# This option determines what states should be displayed in the web
# interface for hosts/services that have not yet been checked.
# Values: 0 = leave hosts/services that have not been check yet in their original state
#         1 = mark hosts/services that have not been checked yet as PENDING (default)

use_pending_states=1


# Logging

# USE LOGGING
# If you want to log information from cgi's (e.g. all submitted commands)
# then set this option to 1, default is 0 (off).
# WARNING:
# This log is highly experimental and changes may occure without notice. Use at your own risk!!

use_logging=@ENABLECGILOG@


# CGI LOG FILE
# This is the cgi log file for information about what users are doing.
# At the moment only submitted commands from cmd.cgi will be logged.

cgi_log_file=@CGILOGDIR@/icinga-cgi.log


# CGI LOG ROTATION METHOD
# This is the log rotation method that should be used to rotate
# the cgi log file. Values are as follows..
#	n	= None - don't rotate the log
#	h	= Hourly rotation (top of the hour)
#	d	= Daily rotation (midnight every day)
#	w	= Weekly rotation (midnight on Saturday evening)
#	m	= Monthly rotation (midnight last day of month)

cgi_log_rotation_method=d


# CGI LOG ARCHIVE PATH
# This is the directory where archived (rotated) cgi log files should be
# placed (assuming you've chosen to do log rotation).

cgi_log_archive_path=@CGILOGDIR@


# FORCE COMMENT
# This option forces the users of to comment every action they perform.
# The comments get logged into cgi log file. This option only has effect
# if logging is switched on. See option "use_logging"
# Default  is 0 (off), to activate it set it to 1 (on).

enforce_comments_on_actions=0


# FIRST DAY OF WEEK
# Here you can set if your week starts on sunday or monday.
# Default is 0 (Sunday), set it to 1 if your week start monday.

first_day_of_week=0


# AUTHENTICATION USAGE
# This option controls whether or not the CGIs will use any
# authentication when displaying host and service information, as
# well as committing commands to Icinga for processing.
#
# Read the HTML documentation to learn how the authorization works!
#
# NOTE: It is a really *bad* idea to disable authorization, unless
# you plan on removing the command CGI (cmd.cgi)!  Failure to do
# so will leave you wide open to kiddies messing with Icinga and
# possibly hitting you with a denial of service attack by filling up
# your drive by continuously writing to your command file!
#
# Setting this value to 0 will cause the CGIs to *not* use
# authentication (bad idea), while any other value will make them
# use the authentication functions (the default).

use_authentication=1




# USE CLIENT CERTIFICATTES
# This option controls whether the value of the web server environment
# variable REMOTE_USER or SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN will be used. The name of
# the directive is a bit misleading because unless you set up the use
# of client certificates the value has to be set to zero (0). Setting
# the value to one (1) requires "SSLUserName SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN" and
# several other options in your web server config. Please consult your
# web server configuration documentation for details.
# 
# Values:
# 0 = Use web server environment variable REMOTE_USER to get the user
#	logged in. Don't use client certificates (default)
# 1 = Use web server environment variable SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN to get
#	the user logged in. Use client certificates

use_ssl_authentication=0




# LOWERCASE USER NAME
# This option controls whether or not the username is converted
# to all lowercase letters. Can be useful if the username is stored
# in Active Directory (case-insensitive).

lowercase_user_name=0




# DEFAULT USER
# Setting this variable will define a default user name that can
# access pages without authentication.  This allows people within a
# secure domain (i.e., behind a firewall) to see the current status
# without authenticating.  You may want to use this to avoid basic
# authentication if you are not using a secure server since basic
# authentication transmits passwords in the clear.
#
# Important:  Do not define a default username unless you are
# running a secure web server and are sure that everyone who has
# access to the CGIs has been authenticated in some manner!  If you
# define this variable, anyone who has not authenticated to the web
# server will inherit all rights you assign to this user!

#default_user_name=guest



# SYSTEM/PROCESS INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# have access to viewing the Icinga process information as
# provided by the Extended Information CGI (extinfo.cgi).  By
# default, *no one* has access to this unless you choose to
# not use authorization.  You may use an asterisk (*) to
# authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

# CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can view ALL configuration information (hosts, commands, etc).
# By default, users can only view configuration information
# for the hosts and services they are contacts for. You may use
# an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has authenticated
# to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

# SYSTEM/PROCESS COMMAND ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can issue shutdown and restart commands to Icinga via the
# command CGI (cmd.cgi).  Users in this list can also change
# the program mode to active or standby. By default, *no one*
# has access to this unless you choose to not use authorization.
# You may use an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has
# authenticated to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

#authorized_contactgroup_for_system_commands=


# GLOBAL HOST/SERVICE VIEW ACCESS
# These two options are comma-delimited lists of all usernames that
# can view information for all hosts and services that are being
# monitored.  By default, users can only view information
# for hosts or services that they are contacts for (unless you
# you choose to not use authorization). You may use an asterisk (*)
# to authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too.

# CGI (cmd.cgi) for all hosts and services that are being monitored.
# By default, users can only issue commands for hosts or services
# that they are contacts for (unless you you choose to not use

# READ-ONLY USERS
# A comma-delimited list of usernames that have read-only rights in
# the CGIs.  This will block any service or host commands normally shown
# on the extinfo CGI pages. It will also block comments and downtimes
# from being shown to read-only users.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

#authorized_for_read_only=user1,user2

# READ-ONLY FOR COMMENTS USERS
# A comma-delimited list of usernames that have rights to view comments in
# the CGIs. If user is defined as read-only and you add the same user to
# this options, then the user can still see comments. If user is NOT
# read-only then the options to delete comments in extinfo.cgi are not
# displayed as well.

#authorized_for_comments_read_only=user1,user2
#authorized_contactgroup_for_comments_read_only=


# READ-ONLY FOR DOWNTIMES USERS
# A comma-delimited list of usernames that have rights to view downtimes in
# the CGIs. If user is defined as read-only and you add the same user to
# this options, then the user can still see downtimes. If user is NOT
# read-only then the options to delete downtimes in extinfo.cgi are not
# displayed as well.

#authorized_for_downtimes_read_only=user1,user2
#authorized_contactgroup_for_downtimes_read_only=


# SHOW ALL SERVICES THE HOST IS AUTHORIZED FOR
# By default, a user can see all services on a host, if the user is
# authorized as contact for the host only. By disabling this option,
# the user must be an authorized contact for the service too in order
# to view it.
# Values: 0 - disabled, user must be authorized for services too
#         1 - enabled, user can view all services on authorized host

show_all_services_host_is_authorized_for=1


# SHOW PARTIAL HOSTGROUPS
# By default (meaning the directive is not present or disabled), a user
# only sees a hostgroup and the hosts within it if they are an authorised
# contact for all of the hosts of the group. The behaviour can be changed
# using the directive show_partial_hostgroups=1.
# When enabled, the hostgroups overview will show a partial listing of hosts
# that the user is an authorised contact for within each hostgroup.
# It will also add the string "(Partial Hostgroups Enabled)" to the top of
# the Hostgroup Overview to help prevent any confusion over whether the option
# is in use or not. However for privacy reasons, hostgroups that are only showing
# a partial listing are not specifically indicated.
# 
# COMPATIBILITY NOTICE: As with any tweak made to the output of the CGIs, enabling
# this option may adversely impact third party programs that rely on 'screen scraping'
# to get their information. If you encounter such a problem, turn this option back
# to its default of off and encourage the developer(s) of the program to use JSON
# for their data needs instead.
# 
# Values: 0 - disabled, user only sees full hostgroups (default)
#         1 - enabled, user sees partial hostgroups

show_partial_hostgroups=0



# STATUSMAP BACKGROUND IMAGE
# This option allows you to specify an image to be used as a background
# in the statusmap CGI if you use the user-supplied coordinates layout method.
# The background image is not be available in any other layout methods. It is
# assumed that the image resides in the HTML images path (i.e. 
# /usr/local/icinga/share/images). This path is automatically determined by
# appending "/images" to the path specified by the physical_html_path directive.
#
# NOTE: The image file can be in GIF, JPEG, PNG, or GD2 format. However, GD2
# format (preferably in uncompressed format) is recommended, as it will reduce
# the CPU load when the CGI generates the map image.

#statusmap_background_image=smbackground.gd2




# STATUSMAP TRANSPARENCY INDEX COLOR
# These options set the r,g,b values of the background color used the statusmap CGI,
# so normal browsers that can't show real png transparency set the desired color as
# a background color instead (to make it look pretty).
# Defaults to white: (R,G,B) = (255,255,255).

#color_transparency_index_r=255
#color_transparency_index_g=255
#color_transparency_index_b=255




# DEFAULT STATUSMAP LAYOUT METHOD
# This option allows you to specify the default layout method
# the statusmap CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you do
# not use this option, the default is to use user-defined
# coordinates.  Valid options are as follows:
#	0 = User-defined coordinates
#	1 = Depth layers
#       2 = Collapsed tree
#       3 = Balanced tree
#       4 = Circular
#       5 = Circular (Marked Up)
#       6 = Baloon (Marked Up)

# of various CGIs (extinfo, outages, status, statusmap and tac).

refresh_rate=90


# REFRESH TYPE
# This option determines what type of refresh should be used.
# You can choose between http header and javascript. By

# acknowledgements is checked or unchecked

persistent_ack_comments=0


# SOUND OPTIONS
# These options allow you to specify an optional audio file
# that should be played in your browser window when there are
# problems on the network.  The audio files are used only in
# the status CGI.  Only the sound for the most critical problem
# will be played.  Order of importance (higher to lower) is as
# follows: unreachable hosts, down hosts, critical services,
# warning services, and unknown services. If there are no
# visible problems, the sound file optionally specified by
# 'normal_sound' variable will be played.
#
#
# <varname>=<sound_file>
#
# Note: All audio files must be placed in the /media subdirectory
# under the HTML path (i.e. /usr/local/icinga/share/media/).

# cgi will show child hosts for the selected host.
#	0 = disabled
#	1 = only show immediate child hosts
#	2 = show immediate and all child hosts
# NOTE: Option 2 could be a real performance killer in
# large installations, so use with care.
# By default disabled, as this could be a performance killer.

extinfo_show_child_hosts=0



# SUPPRESS MAINTENANCE DOWNTIME
# This options suppresses the state coloring of hosts and services
# that are in a scheduled downtime. It sets their coloring to gray,
# so they no longer draw extra attention to themselves, making it
# so only actual problems are the ones that stand out.
# By default it is disabled.

suppress_maintenance_downtime=0


# SHOW TAC INFORMATION IN TOP FRAME
# This options places tactical overview information in
# the top frame similar to the view that's in icinga-web.
# By default it is enabled.

show_tac_header=1


# SHOW PENDING IN TAC HEADER
# This options enables the display of pending counts in
# the tac header. If your display is less than 1024x768

# CSV DATA ENCLOSURE
# This option determines the character which should act as
# data enclosure to wrap in the data. Default is "'".

#csv_data_enclosure='



# TAB-FRIENDLY <TITLE>S
# Activating this option changes the <title> of status.cgi
# and extinfo.cgi when they refer to a single host, service,
# or group. They will then read:
#	[Host]
#	{HostGroup}
#	ServiceDesc @ Host
#	(ServiceGroup)
# These are easier to read and find if you use (many) tabs
# in your browser.
# Default is enabled. 0=disabled, 1=enabled

tab_friendly_titles=1


# SERVICE STATES TO ANNOTATE WITH CURRENT NOTIFICATION NO.
# Set this to an OR of the service state identifiers for
# which status.cgi should not only report "Attempts" (e.g.,
# "3/3" for a HARD non-OK state with max_check_attempts=3)
# but also the current notification number ("(#0)" if no
# problem notification has been sent yet, etc.). This is
# helpful to identify services which switched between
# different non-OK states a lot, or services which have a
# first_notification_delay set and are "not yet officially"
# considered in trouble.
# Relevant values from include/statusdata.h (look them up
# *there* if you want to be *really* sure):
#	#define	SERVICE_PENDING		1
#	#define	SERVICE_OK		2
#	#define	SERVICE_WARNING		4
#	#define	SERVICE_UNKNOWN		8
#	#define	SERVICE_CRITICAL	16
# You'll likely want to use add_notif_num_hard=0 (default)
# or add_notif_num_hard=28 (warn+crit+unknown). There's an
# add_notif_num_soft affecting services in a SOFT state
# for sake of completeness, too.

#add_notif_num_hard=28
#add_notif_num_soft=0



# SPLUNK INTEGRATION OPTIONS
# These options allow you to enable integration with Splunk
# in the web interface.  If enabled, you'll be presented with
# "Splunk It" links in various places in the CGIs (log file,
# alert history, host/service detail, etc).  Useful if you're
# trying to research why a particular problem occurred.
# For more information on Splunk, visit http://www.splunk.com/

# This option determines whether the Splunk integration is enabled
# Values: 0 = disable Splunk integration
#         1 = enable Splunk integration

#enable_splunk_integration=1


# This option should be the URL used to access your instance of Splunk

#splunk_url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/
