t/ and t-tap/ for cgis and core functionality

RHEL
$ sudo yum install perl-HTML-Lint
$ sudo yum install perl-Test-WWW-Mechanize

Debian
$ sudo apt-get install libipc-run3-perl libtest-most-perl libhtml-lint-perl libtest-www-mechanize-cgiapp-perl

$ ./configure
$ make test

tests/ contains a variety of test config files, which can be installed into sysconfdir/icinga/tests and then included
in your icinga.cfg for keeping resolved issues tested while implementing new stuff.

$ sudo make install-testconfig

Debug Hints

If you are debugging with gdb or common tools, make sure that you are running the compiled binaries, not the installed ones. make install normally strips the debug symbols.
A gdb cheatsheet can be found here: http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/GDB-Commands.html

Building the source


Configure

./configure behavior with different flags:

    * enable modules
    * set prefix
    * set users
    * set libs/includes

Make

Compiling different things, just type 'make' to see all available options

Make Install

Test if different installing options do what they are expected to do e.g. fullinstall should do everything.


Check Configuration

    * Backup your current configuration and try to set several things.
    * Change literals, strings, does it resolve in the expected behavior, or do you encounter something strange?
    * Does e.g. setting the retry_interval to a test value really result like desired?
    * Check back on the docs and try to set suggested values and configurations - does it really work?
    * Try to set extrem values (absolute minimum/maximum) and watch the resulting behavior.

    * Generate a test configuration with e.g. http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Generator-TestConfig/
    * Play around with random host behaviour


Debugging

icinga.cfg provides debug settings. Set them to those values to get everything:

    * debug_level=-1 (everything)
    * debug_verbosity=2 (very detailed)
    * debug_file=/where/you/have/enough/storage/icinga.debug
    * max_debug_file_size=1000000000 (1GB)


Running the Core

    * Are Macros processed correctly?
    * How do the illegal chars in macros affect the string escaping?
    * Host States are expected - e.g. host is down when you disable the network route temporarly?
    * Service checks behave correctly
    * External Commands are being processed
    * Passive checks are working?
    * Are the permissions on the command pipe set correctly, does it work like expected?

    * Is the daemon running, but a dead daemon not processing any checks and results - what might have caused that, why does it hang?

    * States are going from soft to hard, state changes are happening correctly?
    * Notifications are being sent correctly
    * Escalations are being handled they way they are expected, Escalation conditions defined work as they should


Errors

    * Segfault on the Core - why this?
    * Faulty modules being loaded?
    * Are there any noticable memory leaks
    * gcc -Wall on Makefile.in if not already set
    * gdb, strace, valgrind


Plugins

    * Matches the check config for the plugins, is there anything different from the docs to the real config for check commands?


=====================================================================================================================
= IDOUTILS
=====================================================================================================================

Configure

./configure --enable-idoutils

    * --enable-ssl
    * --enable-oracle
    * oracle libs/includes

Make

    * make idoutils shows warnings/errors?

Make Install

    * make install-idoutils does install all files needed to run?
    * configs are not overwritten, check on the sample ones.


Check Configuration

    * Backup your current configuration and try to set several things.
    * Change literals, strings, does it resolve in the expected behavior, or do you encounter something strange?
    * Does e.g. setting the max_servicechecks_age to a test value really result like desired?
    * Check back on the docs and try to set suggested values and configurations - does it really work?
    * Try to set extrem values (absolute minimum/maximum) and watch the resulting behavior.


Debugging

ido2db.cfg and idomod.cfg provide debug settings. Set them to those values to get everything:

    * debug_level=-1 (everything)
    * debug_verbosity=2 (very detailed)
    * debug_file=/where/you/have/enough/storage/ido2db.debug / idomod.debug
    * max_debug_file_size=1000000000 (1GB)

idomod
The output is rather larger as it's directly the functions being called when new data gets there through from the core. Afterwards this data is being processed on the socket.

ido2db
The debugfile only get's written, if iodmod connects correctly through the socket. So if it's not updated, this is a reminder, that there's something wrong with idomod or the socket being created/used.


Setup

IDOUtils consisting of idomod and ido2db can be setup in different combinations.

Sockets

Set different sockets in idomod.cfg and ido2db.cfg, but make sure they match.
Also if they don't check on the erorr messages and look forward to "how to improve the error messages"?

    * Unix socket both on local machine, database local too
    * Unix socket both on local machine, database extern
    * TCP socket (with and without SSL) idomod and ido2db local, db local or extern
    * TCP socket (with and without SSL) idomod local and ido2db extern, db extern

Databases

Configure different databases in the background and apply different settings on ido2db.cfg (create e.g. ido2db.cfg-pgsql and just copying them over as new ido2db.cfg).

    * MySQL
    * Postgres
    * Oracle


Data

Initial connection

    * check if connection to database is established
    * check on the table [icinga_]instances, if the same name is in idomod.cfg is there
    * check [icinga_]conninfo if idomod and idomod trimming thread left their entries

Config data

    * Stop ido2db, stop Icinga
    * Start ido2db, start Icinga
    * check syslog if everythings fine
    * check tables [icinga_]services/hosts/contacts //groups etc if the information matches
    * check [icinga_]objects for matching objects from your config

Actual state information

    * check [icinga_]host/servicestatus for the hostinformation and compare to those from status.dat and the cgis
    * check the debug log for updates happening (insert_or_update functions on those tables

Historical Data

    * Check if all rows get correctly updated
    * Check over period if all checks get into the database

Other data

    * Check if output and long_output are being written

Queries

    * Check on the RDBMS if there are queries causing performance issues
    * do queries fail or produce strange output (what you might get through the database or the debug log)
    * compare MySQL, Postgres and Oracle regarding their performance



=====================================================================================================================
= CLASSIC UI / CGIS
=====================================================================================================================

    * Run the compiled cgis on the shell to get an idea, which environment variables need to be exported. examples are:

export REMOTE_USER=icinga
export QUERY_STRING=host=test1
export REQUEST_METHOD=GET

    * Run the cgis (from source) on shell and call installed ones via apache - differences?
    * Run the cgis with an empty QUERY_STRING
    * Run strace (or truss -f on Solaris) or gdb like this

$ export REQUEST_METHOD=GET ; gdb /home/icinga/icinga-core/cgi/status.cgi



=====================================================================================================================
= GET TEST CONFIGS
=====================================================================================================================

The easiest way to create a test config is Monitoring-Generator-TestConfig - a nifty Library written by Sven Nierlein.

http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Generator-TestConfig/

# perl -MCPAN -e shell
CPAN> install Monitoring::Generator::TestConfig
CPAN> quit

or without interacting with the shell:

# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Monitoring::Generator::TestConfig'

Afterwards create this little Perl script:

# vim gen_icinga_testconf.pl

#!/usr/bin/perl

use Monitoring::Generator::TestConfig;

my $ngt = Monitoring::Generator::TestConfig->new(
    'output_dir' => '/tmp/test_icinga' ,
    layout => 'icinga',
    binary => '/usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga',
    overwrite_dir => 1,
    verbose => 1,
    hostcount => 200,
    routercount => 1,
    services_per_host => 10,
    host_settings =>  {
      check_period => '24x7',
    },
    host_types =>  {
      'down'         => 2, # percentage
      'up'           => 96,
      'flap'         => 1,
      'pending'      => 1,
      'random'       => 0,
    },
    service_types =>  {
      'ok'           => 96, # percentage
      'warning'      => 2,
      'critical'     => 1,
      'pending'      => 1,
      'random'       => 0,
    },
    service_settings =>  {
      check_interval => 1,
      retry_interval => 1,
    },
    'main_cfg' => {
      'nagios_user'  => 'icinga',
      'nagios_group' => 'icinga',
    },

);
$ngt->create();

# chmod +x gen_icinga_testconf.pl

Adapt it for your needs as described over here: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Monitoring-Generator-TestConfig/lib/Monitoring/Generator/TestConfig.pm

Running this script will create a complete configuration including test plugins in /tmp/test_icinga. You can then start the tests with

# /usr/local/icinga/bin/icinga -d /tmp/test_icinga/icinga.cfg
