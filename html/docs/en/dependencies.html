  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>

  <p>Service and host dependencies are an advanced feature of Icinga that allow you to control the behavior of hosts and
  services based on the status of one or more other hosts or services. We'll explain how dependencies work, along with the
  differences between host and service dependencies.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Service Dependencies Overview</strong></span></p>

  <p>There are a few things you should know about service dependencies:</p>

  <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">

      <p>A service can be dependent on services which are not associated with the same host</p>
    </li>

      <p>Service dependencies are not inherited (unless specifically configured to)</p>
    </li>

      <p>Service dependencies can be used to cause service check execution and service notifications to be suppressed under
      different circumstances (OK, WARNING, UNKNOWN, and/or CRITICAL states)</p>

      <p>Service dependencies might only be valid during specific <a class="link" href="timeperiods.html" title="Time Periods">timeperiods</a></p>
    </li>
</ol></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Defining Service Dependencies</strong></span></p>

  <p>First, the basics. You create service dependencies by adding <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-servicedependency">service
  dependency definitions</a> in your <a class="link" href="configobject.html" title="Object Configuration Overview">object config file(s)</a>. In each definition you specify
  the <span class="emphasis"><em>dependent</em></span> service, the service you are <span class="emphasis"><em>depending on</em></span>, and the criteria (if any)
  that cause the execution and notification dependencies to fail (these are described later).</p>

  <p>You can create several dependencies for a given service, but you must add a separate service dependency definition for
  each dependency you create.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Example Service Dependencies</strong></span></p>

  <p>The image below shows an example logical layout of service notification and execution dependencies. Different services are
  dependent on other services for notifications and check execution.</p>

  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/service-dependencies.png"></span></p>

  <p>In this example, the dependency definitions for <span class="emphasis"><em>Service F</em></span> on <span class="emphasis"><em>Host C</em></span> would be
  defined as follows:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define servicedependency{
        host_name                       Host B
        service_description             Service D
        dependent_host_name             Host C
        dependent_service_description   Service F
        execution_failure_criteria      o
        notification_failure_criteria   w,u
        }

 define servicedependency{
        host_name                       Host B
        service_description             Service E
        dependent_host_name             Host C
        dependent_service_description   Service F
        execution_failure_criteria      n
        notification_failure_criteria   w,u,c
        }

 define servicedependency{
        host_name                       Host B
        service_description             Service C
        dependent_host_name             Host C
        dependent_service_description   Service F
        execution_failure_criteria      w
        notification_failure_criteria   c
        }</pre>

  <p>The other dependency definitions shown in the image above would be defined as follows:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define servicedependency{
        host_name                       Host A
        service_description             Service A
        dependent_host_name             Host B
        dependent_service_description   Service D
        execution_failure_criteria      u
        notification_failure_criteria   n
        }

 define servicedependency{
        host_name                       Host A
        service_description             Service B
        dependent_host_name             Host B
        dependent_service_description   Service E
        execution_failure_criteria      w,u
        notification_failure_criteria   c
        }

 define servicedependency{
        host_name                       Host B
        service_description             Service C
        dependent_host_name             Host B
        dependent_service_description   Service E
        execution_failure_criteria      n
        notification_failure_criteria   w,u,c
        }</pre>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>How Service Dependencies Are Tested</strong></span></p>

  <p>Before Icinga executes a service check or sends notifications out for a service, it will check to see if the
  service has any dependencies. If it doesn't have any dependencies, the check is executed or the notification is sent out as it
  normally would be. If the service <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> have one or more dependencies, Icinga will check each
  dependency entry as follows:</p>

  <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Icinga gets the current status<sup> <a class="link" href="dependencies.html#dependencies-hard_dependencies">*</a>
      </sup> of the service that is being <span class="emphasis"><em>depended upon</em></span>.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Icinga compares the current status of the service that is being <span class="emphasis"><em>depended upon</em></span> against
      either the execution or notification failure options in the dependency definition (whichever one is relevant at the
      time).</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>If the current status of the service that is being <span class="emphasis"><em>depended upon</em></span> matches one of the failure
      options, the dependency is said to have failed and Icinga will break out of the dependency check loop.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>If the current state of the service that is being <span class="emphasis"><em>depended upon</em></span> does not match any of the failure
      options for the dependency entry, the dependency is said to have passed and Icinga will go on and check the next
      dependency entry.</p>
    </li>
</ol></div>

  <p>This cycle continues until either all dependencies for the service have been checked or until one dependency check
  fails.</p>

  <p><a name="dependencies-hard_dependencies"></a></p>

  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p><sup>*</sup>One important thing to note is that by default, Icinga will use the most current
    <a class="link" href="statetypes.html" title="State Types">hard state</a> of the service(s) that is/are being depended upon when it does the dependeny
    checks. If you want Icinga to use the most current state of the services (regardless of whether its a soft or hard
    state), enable the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-soft_state_dependencies">soft_state_dependencies</a> option.</p>
  </td></tr>
</table></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Execution Dependencies</strong></span></p>

  <p>Execution dependencies are used to restrict when <a class="link" href="activechecks.html" title="Active Checks">active checks</a> of a service can be
  performed. <a class="link" href="passivechecks.html" title="Passive Checks">Passive checks</a> are not restricted by execution dependencies.</p>

  <p>If <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the execution dependency tests for the service <span class="emphasis"><em>passed</em></span>, Icinga
  will execute the check of the service as it normally would. If even just one of the execution dependencies for a service fails,
  Icinga will temporarily prevent the execution of checks for that (dependent) service. At some point in the future the
  execution dependency tests for the service may all pass. If this happens, Icinga will start checking the service again as
  it normally would. More information on the check scheduling logic can be found <a class="link" href="checkscheduling.html" title="Service and Host Check Scheduling">here</a>.</p>

  <p>In the example above, <span class="bold"><strong>Service E</strong></span> would have failed execution dependencies if <span class="bold"><strong>Service B</strong></span> is in a WARNING or UNKNOWN state. If this was the case, the service check would not be
  performed and the check would be scheduled for (potential) execution at a later time.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Notification Dependencies</strong></span></p>

  <p>If <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the notification dependency tests for the service <span class="emphasis"><em>passed</em></span>,
  Icinga will send notifications out for the service as it normally would. If even just one of the notification
  dependencies for a service fails, Icinga will temporarily repress notifications for that (dependent) service. At some
  point in the future the notification dependency tests for the service may all pass. If this happens, Icinga will start
  sending out notifications again as it normally would for the service. More information on the notification logic can be found
  <a class="link" href="notifications.html" title="Notifications">here</a>.</p>

  <p>In the example above, <span class="bold"><strong>Service F</strong></span> would have failed notification dependencies if <span class="bold"><strong>Service C</strong></span> is in a CRITICAL state, <span class="emphasis"><em>and/or</em></span><span class="bold"><strong>Service D</strong></span>
  is in a WARNING or UNKNOWN state, <span class="emphasis"><em>and/or</em></span> if <span class="bold"><strong>Service E</strong></span> is in a WARNING,
  UNKNOWN, or CRITICAL state. If this were the case, notifications for the service would not be sent out.</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Dependency Inheritance</strong></span></p>

  <p>As mentioned before, service dependencies are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> inherited by default. In the example above you can
  see that Service F is dependent on Service E. However, it does not automatically inherit Service E's dependencies on Service B
  and Service C. In order to make Service F dependent on Service C we had to add another service dependency definition. There is
  no dependency definition for Service B, so Service F is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> dependent on Service B.</p>

  <p>If you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> wish to make service dependencies inheritable, you must use the
  <span class="emphasis"><em>inherits_parent</em></span> directive in the <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-servicedependency">service
  dependency</a> definition. When this directive is enabled, it indicates that the dependency inherits dependencies of the
  service <span class="emphasis"><em>that is being depended upon</em></span> (also referred to as the master service). In other words, if the master
  service is dependent upon other services and any one of those dependencies fail, this dependency will also fail.</p>

  <p>In the example above, imagine that you want to add a new dependency for service F to make it dependent on service A. You
  could create a new dependency definition that specified service F as the <span class="emphasis"><em>dependent</em></span> service and service A as
  being the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> service (i.e. the service <span class="emphasis"><em>that is being dependend on</em></span>). You could
  alternatively modify the dependency definition for services D and F to look like this:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define servicedependency{
        host_name                       Host B
        service_description             Service D
        dependent_host_name             Host C
        dependent_service_description   Service F
        execution_failure_criteria      o
        notification_failure_criteria   n
        inherits_parent         1
        }</pre>

  <p>Since the <span class="emphasis"><em>inherits_parent</em></span> directive is enabled, the dependency between services A and D will be
  tested when the dependency between services F and D are being tested.</p>

  <p>Dependencies can have multiple levels of inheritence. If the dependency definition between A and D had its
  <span class="emphasis"><em>inherits_parent</em></span> directive enable and service A was dependent on some other service (let's call it service
  G), the service F would be dependent on services D, A, and G (each with potentially different criteria).</p>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Host Dependencies</strong></span></p>

  <p>As you'd probably expect, host dependencies work in a similiar fashion to service dependencies. The difference is that
  they're for hosts, not services.</p>

  <div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip">

<th align="left">Tip</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
    <p>Do not confuse host dependencies with parent/child host relationships. You should be using parent/child host
    relationships (defined with the <span class="emphasis"><em>parents</em></span> directive in <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-host">host</a>
    definitions) for most cases, rather than host dependencies. A description of how parent/child host relationships work can be
    found in the documentation on <a class="link" href="networkreachability.html" title="Determining Status and Reachability of Network Hosts">network reachability</a>.</p>

</table></div>

  <p>Here are the basics about host dependencies:</p>

  <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
      <p>A host can be dependent on one or more other host</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Host dependencies are not inherited (unless specifically configured to)</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Host dependencies can be used to cause host check execution and host notifications to be suppressed under different
      circumstances (UP, DOWN, and/or UNREACHABLE states)</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p>Host dependencies might only be valid during specific <a class="link" href="timeperiods.html" title="Time Periods">timeperiods</a></p>
    </li>
</ol></div>

  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Example Host Dependencies</strong></span></p>

  <p>The image below shows an example of the logical layout of host notification dependencies. Different hosts are dependent on
  other hosts for notifications.</p>

  <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/host-dependencies.png"></span></p>

  <p>In the example above, the dependency definitions for <span class="emphasis"><em>Host C</em></span> would be defined as follows:</p>

  <pre class="screen"> define hostdependency{
        host_name                       Host A
        dependent_host_name             Host C
        notification_failure_criteria   d
        }

 define hostdependency{
        host_name                       Host B
        dependent_host_name             Host C
        notification_failure_criteria   d,u
        }</pre>

  <p>As with service dependencies, host dependencies are not inherited. In the example image you can see that Host C does not
  inherit the host dependencies of Host B. In order for Host C to be dependent on Host A, a new host dependency definition must be
  defined.</p>

  <p>Host notification dependencies work in a similiar manner to service notification dependencies. If <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
  of the notification dependency tests for the host <span class="emphasis"><em>pass</em></span>, Icinga will send notifications out for the
  host as it normally would. If even just one of the notification dependencies for a host fails, Icinga will temporarily
  repress notifications for that (dependent) host. At some point in the future the notification dependency tests for the host may
  all pass. If this happens, Icinga will start sending out notifications again as it normally would for the host. More
  information on the notification logic can be found <a class="link" href="notifications.html" title="Notifications">here</a>.</p>
