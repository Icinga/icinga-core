    <p>I've had a lot of questions as to exactly how notifications work. This will attempt to explain exactly when and how host and
    service notifications are sent out, as well as who receives them.</p>

    <p>Notification escalations are explained <a class="link" href="escalations.html" title="7.9. Notification Escalations">here</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="5.11.2. When Do Notifications Occur?">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="when"></a>5.11.2. When Do Notifications Occur?</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The decision to send out notifications is made in the service check and host check logic. The calculations for whether a
    notification is to be sent are only triggered when processing a host or service check corresponding to that notification; they are not
    triggered simply because the &lt;notification_interval&gt; has passed since a previous notification was sent. Host and service
    notifications occur in the following instances...</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>When a hard state change occurs. More information on state types and hard state changes can be found <a class="link" href="statetypes.html" title="5.8. State Types">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>When a host or service remains in a hard non-OK state and the time specified by the
        &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>notification_interval</em></span>&gt; option in the host or service definition has passed since the last notification
        was sent out (for that specified host or service).</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="5.11.3. Who Gets Notified?">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="who"></a>5.11.3. Who Gets Notified?</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>Each host and service definition has a &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>contact_groups</em></span>&gt; option that specifies what contact groups
    receive notifications for that particular host or service. Contact groups can contain one or more individual contacts.</p>

    <p>When Icinga sends out a host or service notification, it will notify each contact that is a member of any contact groups
    specified in the &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>contactgroups</em></span>&gt; option of the service definition. Icinga realizes that a contact may
    be a member of more than one contact group, so it removes duplicate contact notifications before it does anything.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="5.11.4. What Filters Must Be Passed In Order For Notifications To Be Sent?">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="whatfilters"></a>5.11.4. What Filters Must Be Passed In Order For Notifications To Be Sent?</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>Just because there is a need to send out a host or service notification doesn't mean that any contacts are going to get notified.
    There are several filters that potential notifications must pass before they are deemed worthy enough to be sent out. Even then,
    specific contacts may not be notified if their notification filters do not allow for the notification to be sent to them. Let's go into
    the filters that have to be passed in more detail...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="5.11.5. Program-Wide Filter:">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="programwidefilters"></a>5.11.5. Program-Wide Filter:</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The first filter that notifications must pass is a test of whether or not notifications are enabled on a program-wide basis. This
    is initially determined by the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-enable_notifications">enable_notifications</a> directive in the main config
    file, but may be changed during runtime from the web interface. If notifications are disabled on a program-wide basis, no host or
    service notifications can be sent out - period. If they are enabled on a program-wide basis, there are still other tests that must be
    passed...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="5.11.6. Service and Host Filters:">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="servicehostfilters"></a>5.11.6. Service and Host Filters:</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The first filter for host or service notifications is a check to see if the host or service is in a period of <a class="link" href="downtime.html" title="7.16. Scheduled Downtime">scheduled downtime</a>. It it is in a scheduled downtime, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets notified</strong></span>.
    If it isn't in a period of downtime, it gets passed on to the next filter. As a side note, notifications for services are suppressed if
    the host they're associated with is in a period of scheduled downtime.</p>

    <p>The second filter for host or service notification is a check to see if the host or service is <a class="link" href="flapping.html" title="7.8. Detection and Handling of State Flapping">flapping</a> (if you enabled flap detection). If the service or host is currently flapping, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets notified</strong></span>. Otherwise it gets passed to the next filter.</p>

    <p>The third host or service filter that must be passed is the <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-host">host</a>- or <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-service">service</a>-specific notification options (see links and table below for details). Each service
    definition contains options that determine whether or not notifications can be sent out for warning states, critical states, and
    recoveries. Similiarly, each host definition contains options that determine whether or not notifications can be sent out when the host
    goes down, becomes unreachable, or recovers. If the host or service notification does not pass these options, <span class="bold"><strong>no
    one gets notified</strong></span>. If it does pass these options, the notification gets passed to the next filter...</p>

    <p>The fourth host or service filter that must be passed is the time period test. Each host and service definition has a
    &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>notification_period</em></span>&gt; option that specifies which time period contains valid notification times for the host
    or service. If the time that the notification is being made does not fall within a valid time range in the specified time period,
    <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets contacted</strong></span>. If it falls within a valid time range, the notification gets passed to the next
    filter...</p>

<th align="left">Note</th>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
      <p>If the time period filter is not passed, Icinga will reschedule the next notification for the host or service (if its in
      a non-OK state) for the next valid time present in the time period. This helps ensure that contacts are notified of problems as soon
      as possible when the next valid time in time period arrives.</p>
    </td></tr>
</table></div>

    <p>The last set of host or service filters is conditional upon two things: (1) a notification was already sent out about a problem
    with the host or service at some point in the past and (2) the host or service has remained in the same non-OK state that it was when
    the last notification went out. If these two criteria are met, then Icinga will check and make sure the time that has passed
    since the last notification went out either meets or exceeds the value specified by the
    &lt;<span class="emphasis"><em>notification_interval</em></span>&gt; option in the host or service definition. If not enough time has passed since the
    last notification, <span class="bold"><strong>no one gets contacted</strong></span>. If either enough time has passed since the last notification
    or the two criteria for this filter were not met, the notification will be sent out! Whether or not it actually is sent to individual
    contacts is up to another set of filters...</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="contactfilters"></a>5.11.7. Contact Filters:</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>At this point the notification has passed the program mode filter and all host or service filters and Icinga starts to
    notify <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-contact">all the people it should</a>. Does this mean that each contact is going to receive
    the notification? No! Each contact has their own set of filters that the notification must pass before they receive it.</p>

    <p>The first filter that must be passed for each contact are the notification options. Each contact definition contains options that
    determine whether or not service notifications can be sent out for warning states, critical states, and recoveries. Each contact
    definition also contains options that determine whether or not host notifications can be sent out when the host goes down, becomes
    unreachable, or recovers. If the host or service notification does not pass these options, <span class="bold"><strong>the contact will not be
    notified</strong></span>. If it does pass these options, the notification gets passed to the next filter...</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="methods"></a>5.11.8. Notification Methods</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>You can have Icinga notify you of problems and recoveries pretty much anyway you want: pager, cellphone, email, instant
    message, audio alert, electric shocker, etc. How notifications are sent depend on the <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-command">notification commands</a> that are defined in your <a class="link" href="config.html" title="3.1. Configuration Overview">object definition
    files</a>.</p>

    <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">

      <p>If you install Icinga according to the <a class="link" href="quickstart.html" title="2.3. Quickstart Installation Guides">quickstart guide</a>, it should be configured to
      send email notifications. You can see the email notification commands that are used by viewing the contents of the following file:

    </td></tr>
</table></div>

    <p>Specific notification methods (paging, etc.) are not directly incorporated into the Icinga code as it just doesn't make
    much sense. The "core" of Icinga is not designed to be an all-in-one application. If service checks were embedded in
    Icinga' core it would be very difficult for users to add new check methods, modify existing checks, etc. Notifications work in a
    similiar manner. There are a thousand different ways to do notifications and there are already a lot of packages out there that handle
    the dirty work, so why re-invent the wheel and limit yourself to a bike tire? Its much easier to let an external entity (i.e. a simple
    script or a full-blown messaging system) do the messy stuff. Some messaging packages that can handle notifications for pagers and
    cellphones are listed below in the resource section.</p>

    <p>There are many ways you could configure Icinga to send notifications out. Its up to you to decide which method(s) you want
    to use. Once you do that you'll have to install any necessary software and configure notification commands in your config files before
    you can use them. Here are just a few possible notification methods:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>Email</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>Pager</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>Phone (SMS)</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>WinPopup message</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>Yahoo, ICQ, or MSN instant message</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>Audio alerts</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>etc...</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>

    <p>Basically anything you can do from a command line can be tailored for use as a notification command.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for an alternative to using email for sending messages to your pager or cellphone, check out these packages.
    They could be used in conjuction with Icinga to send out a notification via a modem when a problem arises. That way you don't
    have to rely on email to send notifications out (remember, email may *not* work if there are network problems). I haven't actually tried
    these packages myself, but others have reported success using them...</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p><a class="link" href="http://www.gnokii.org/" target="_top">Gnokii</a> (SMS software for contacting Nokia phones via GSM network)</p>

    <p>If you want to try out a non-traditional method of notification, you might want to mess around with audio alerts. If you want to
    have audio alerts played on the monitoring server (with synthesized speech), check out <a class="link" href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/" target="_top">Festival</a>. If you'd rather leave the monitoring box alone and have audio
