    <p>The performance of Icinga' monitoring logic can be significantly improved by implementing the use of cached checks. Cached
    checks allow Icinga to forgo executing a host or service check command if it determines a relatively recent check result will do
    instead.</p>

    <p>Regularly scheduled host and service checks will not see a performance improvement with use of cached checks. Cached checks are
    only useful for improving the performance of on-demand host and service checks. Scheduled checks help to ensure that host and service
    states are updated regularly, which may result in a greater possibility their results can be used as cached checks in the future.</p>

    <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/cachedchecks.png"></span></p>

    <p>When Icinga needs to perform an on-demand host or service check, it will make a determination as to whether it can used a
    cached check result or if it needs to perform an actual check by executing a plugin. It does this by checking to see if the last check
    of the host or service occured within the last X minutes, where X is the cached host or service check horizon.</p>

    <p>If the last check was performed within the timeframe specified by the cached check horizon variable, Icinga will use the
    result of the last host or service check and will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> execute a new check. If the host or service has not yet been
    checked, or if the last check falls outside of the cached check horizon timeframe, Icinga will execute a new host or service
    check by running a plugin.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.21.4. What This Really Means">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="whatthismeans"></a>7.21.4. What This Really Means</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>Icinga performs on-demand checks because it need to know the current state of a host or service <span class="emphasis"><em>at that exact
    moment</em></span> in time. Utilizing cached checks allows you to make Icinga think that recent check results are "good enough"
    for determining the current state of hosts, and that it doesn't need to go out and actually re-check the status of that host or
    service.</p>

    <p>The cached check horizon tells Icinga how recent check results must be in order to reliably reflect the current state of a
    host or service. For example, with a cached check horizon of 30 seconds, you are telling Icinga that if a host's state was
    checked sometime in the last 30 seconds, the result of that check should still be considered the current state of the host.</p>

    <p>The number of cached check results that Icinga can use versus the number of on-demand checks it has to actually execute can
    be considered the cached check "hit" rate. By increasing the cached check horizon to equal the regular check interval of a host, you
    could theoretically achieve a cache hit rate of 100%. In that case all on-demand checks of that host would use cached check results.
    What a performance improvement! But is it really? Probably not.</p>

    <p>The reliability of cached check result information decreases over time. Higher cache hit rates require that previous check results
    are considered "valid" for longer periods of time. Things can change quickly in any network scenario, and there's no guarantee that a
    server that was functioning properly 30 seconds ago isn't on fire right now. There's the tradeoff - reliability versus speed. If you
    have a large cached check horizon, you risk having unreliable check result values being used in the monitoring logic.</p>

    <p>Icinga will eventually determine the correct state of all hosts and services, so even if cached check results prove to
    unreliably represent their true value, Icinga will only work with incorrect information for a short period of time. Even short
    periods of unreliable status information can prove to be a nuisance for admins, as they may receive notifications about problems which
    no longer exist.</p>

    <p>There is no standard cached check horizon or cache hit rate that will be acceptable to every Icinga user. Some people will
    want a short horizon timeframe and a low cache hit rate, while others will want a larger horizon timeframe and a larger cache hit rate
    (with a low reliability rate). Some users may even want to disable cached checks altogether to obtain a 100% reliability rate. Testing
    different horizon timeframes, and their effect on the reliability of status information, is the only want that an individual user will
    find the "right" value for their situation. More information on this is discussed below.</p>

    <p>The following variables determine the timeframes in which a previous host or service check result may be used as a cached host or
    service check result:</p>

<li class="listitem">
        <p>The <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-cached_service_check_horizon">cached_service_check_horizon</a> variable controls cached

    <p>In order to make the most effective use of cached checks, you should:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>Schedule regular checks of your hosts</p>
      </li>

      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>Adjust cached check horizon variables to fit your needs</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>

    <p>You can schedule regular checks of your hosts by specifying a value greater than 0 for <span class="emphasis"><em>check_interval</em></span> option
    in your <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-host">host definitions</a>. If you do this, make sure that you set the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>max_check_attempts</em></span> option to a value greater than 1, or it will cause a big performance hit. This potential
    performance hit is described in detail <a class="link" href="hostchecks.html" title="5.4. Host Checks">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="figure">

    </div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break">

    <p>A good way to determine the proper value for the cached check horizon option is to compare how many on-demand checks Icinga
    has to actually run versus how may it can use cached values for. The <a class="link" href="icingastats.html" title="8.6. Using The Icingastats Utility">icingastats</a> utility can produce
    information on cached checks, which can then be <a class="link" href="perfgraphs.html" title="8.7. Graphing Performance Info With PNP4Nagios">graphed with PNP4Nagios</a>. An example graph that
    compares cached vs. actual on-demand checks is shown above.</p>

    <p>The monitoring installation which produced the graphs had:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>A total of 110 hosts, all of which were checked at regular intervals</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>An average (regularly scheduled) host check interval of 30 minutes with a 5 minute retry interval</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>A <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-cached_host_check_horizon">cached_host_check_horizon</a> of 15 seconds</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>

    <p>The graph shows how many regularly scheduled host checks compared to how many cached host checks have occurred. In this example,
    an average of 77 host checks occur every five minutes. 59 of these (76%) are on-demand checks.</p>

    <p>It also shows how many cached host checks have occurred over time. In this example an average of 21 cached host checks occurs
    every five minutes.</p>

    <p>Remember, cached checks are only available for on-demand checks. Based on the 5 minute averages from the graphs, we see that
    Icinga is able to used cached host check results every 21 out of 59 times an on-demand check has to be run. That may not seem
    much, but these graphs represent a small monitoring environment. Consider that 21 out of 59 is nearly 36% and you can start to see how
    this could significantly help improve host check performance in large environments. That percentage could be higher if the cached host
    check horizon variable value was increased, but that would reduce the reliability of the cached host state information.</p>

    <p>Once you've had a few hours or days worth of PNP4Nagios graphs, you should see how many host and service checks were done by
    executing plugins versus those that used cached check results. Use that information to adjust the cached check horizon variables
    appropriately for your situation. Continue to monitor the PNP4Nagios graphs over time to see how changing the horizon variables affected
    cached check statistics. Rinse and repeat as necessary.</p>
