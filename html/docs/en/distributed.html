    <p>Icinga can be configured to support distributed monitoring of network services and resources. We'll try to briefly explan
    how this can be accomplished...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.2. Goals">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="goals"></a>7.6.2. Goals</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The goal in the distributed monitoring environment that we will describe is to offload the overhead (CPU usage, etc.) of
    performing service checks from a "central" server onto one or more "distributed" servers. Most small to medium sized shops will not have
    a real need for setting up such an environment. However, when you want to start monitoring hundreds or even thousands of
    <span class="emphasis"><em>hosts</em></span> (and several times that many services) using Icinga, this becomes quite important.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.3. Reference Diagram">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="referencediagram"></a>7.6.3. Reference Diagram</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The diagram below should help give you a general idea of how distributed monitoring works with Icinga. We'll be referring
    to the items shown in the diagram as we explain things...</p>

    <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/distributed.png"></span></p>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.4. Central Server vs. Distributed Servers">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="centralvsdistributed"></a>7.6.4. Central Server vs. Distributed Servers</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>When setting up a distributed monitoring environment with Icinga, there are differences in the way the central and
    distributed servers are configured. We'll show you how to configure both types of servers and explain what effects the changes being
    made have on the overall monitoring. For starters, lets describe the purpose of the different types of servers...</p>

    <p>The function of a <span class="emphasis"><em>distributed server</em></span> is to actively perform checks all the services you define for a
    "cluster" of hosts. We use the term "cluster" loosely - it basically just mean an arbitrary group of hosts on your network. Depending on
    your network layout, you may have several cluters at one physical location, or each cluster may be separated by a WAN, its own firewall,
    etc. The important thing to remember to that for each cluster of hosts (however you define that), there is one distributed server that
    runs Icinga and monitors the services on the hosts in the cluster. A distributed server is usually a bare-bones installation of
    Icinga. It doesn't have to have the web interface installed, send out notifications, run event handler scripts, or do anything
    other than execute service checks if you don't want it to. More detailed information on configuring a distributed server comes
    later...</p>

    <p>The purpose of the <span class="emphasis"><em>central server</em></span> is to simply listen for service check results from one or more distributed
    servers. Even though services are occassionally actively checked from the central server, the active checks are only performed in dire
    circumstances, so lets just say that the central server only accepts passive check for now. Since the central server is obtaining <a class="link" href="passivechecks.html" title="5.7. Passive Checks">passive service check</a> results from one or more distributed servers, it serves as the focal point for all
    monitoring logic (i.e. it sends out notifications, runs event handler scripts, determines host states, has the web interface installed,
    etc).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.5. Obtaining Service Check Information From Distributed Monitors">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="servicecheckinfo"></a>7.6.5. Obtaining Service Check Information From Distributed Monitors</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>Okay, before we go jumping into configuration detail we need to know how to send the service check results from the distributed
    servers to the central server. We've already discussed how to submit passive check results to Icinga from same host that
    Icinga is running on (as described in the documentation on <a class="link" href="passivechecks.html" title="5.7. Passive Checks">passive checks</a>), but we haven't
    given any info on how to submit passive check results from other hosts.</p>

    <p>In order to facilitate the submission of passive check results to a remote host, the <a class="link" href="addons.html#addons-nsca">nsca addon</a>
    was written. The addon consists of two pieces. The first is a client program (send_nsca) which is run from a remote host and is used to
    send the service check results to another server. The second piece is the nsca daemon (nsca) which either runs as a standalone daemon or
    under inetd and listens for connections from client programs. Upon receiving service check information from a client, the daemon will
    sumbit the check information to Icinga (on the central server) by inserting a <span class="emphasis"><em>PROCESS_SVC_CHECK_RESULT</em></span>
    command into the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-command_file">external command file</a>, along with the check results. The next time
    Icinga checks for <a class="link" href="extcommands.html" title="7.1. External Commands">external commands</a>, it will find the passive service check information that
    was sent from the distributed server and process it. Easy, huh?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.6. Distributed Server Configuration">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="distributedconfig"></a>7.6.6. Distributed Server Configuration</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>So how exactly is Icinga configured on a distributed server? Basically, its just a bare-bones installation. You don't need
    to install the web interface or have notifications sent out from the server, as this will all be handled by the central server.</p>

    <p>Key configuration changes:</p>

<li class="listitem">

</ul></div>

    <p>In order to make everything come together and work properly, we want the distributed server to report the results of
    <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> service checks to Icinga. We could use <a class="link" href="eventhandlers.html" title="7.3. Event Handlers">event handlers</a> to report
    <span class="emphasis"><em>changes</em></span> in the state of a service, but that just doesn't cut it. In order to force the distributed server to report
    all service check results, you must enabled the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-obsess_over_services">obsess_over_services</a> option in
    the main configuration file and provide a <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-ocsp_command">ocsp_command</a> to be run after every service
    check. We will use the ocsp command to send the results of all service checks to the central server, making use of the send_nsca client
    and nsca daemon (as described above) to handle the tranmission.</p>

    <p>In order to accomplish this, you'll need to define an ocsp command like this:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.7. ocsp_command=submit_check_result">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="oscpsubmitcheckresult"></a>7.6.7. ocsp_command=submit_check_result</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The command definition for the <span class="emphasis"><em>submit_check_result</em></span> command looks something like this:</p>

    <pre class="programlisting"> define command{
      command_name    submit_check_result 
      command_line    /usr/local/icinga/libexec/eventhandlers/submit_check_result $HOSTNAME$ '$SERVICEDESC$' $SERVICESTATE$ '$SERVICEOUTPUT$'
 } </pre>

    <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>submit_check_result</em></span> shell scripts looks something like this (replace <span class="emphasis"><em>central_server</em></span>
    with the IP address of the central server):</p>

    <pre class="programlisting">#!/bin/sh

    <p>That's it! We've sucessfully configured a remote host running Icinga to act as a distributed monitoring server. Let's go
    over exactly what happens with the distributed server and how it sends service check results to Icinga (the steps outlined below
    correspond to the numbers in the reference diagram above):</p>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.8. Central Server Configuration">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="centralconfig"></a>7.6.8. Central Server Configuration</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>We've looked at how distributed monitoring servers should be configured, so let's turn to the central server. For all intents and
    purposes, the central is configured as you would normally configure a standalone server. It is setup as follows:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The central server has the web interface installed (optional, but recommended)</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The central server has its <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-enable_notifications">enable_notifications</a> directive set to 1.
        This will enable notifications. (optional, but recommended)</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The central server has <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-execute_service_checks">active service checks</a> disabled (optional, but
        recommended - see notes below)</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The central server has <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-check_external_commands">external command checks</a> enabled
        (required)</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The central server has <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-accept_passive_service_checks">passive service checks</a> enabled
        (required)</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>

    <p>There are three other very important things that you need to keep in mind when configuring the central server:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The central server must have service definitions for <span class="emphasis"><em>all services</em></span> that are being monitored by all the
        distributed servers. Icinga will ignore passive check results if they do not correspond to a service that has been
        defined.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>If you're only using the central server to process services whose results are going to be provided by distributed hosts, you
        can simply disable all active service checks on a program-wide basis by setting the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-execute_service_checks">execute_service_checks</a> directive to 0. If you're using the central server to
        actively monitor a few services on its own (without the aid of distributed servers), the <span class="emphasis"><em>active_checks_enabled</em></span>
        option of the definitions for service being monitored by distributed servers should be set to 0. This will prevent Icinga
        from actively checking those services.</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>

    <p>It is important that you either disable all service checks on a program-wide basis or disable the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>enable_active_checks</em></span> option in the definitions for each service that is monitored by a distributed server. This
    will ensure that active service checks are never executed under normal circumstances. The services will keep getting rescheduled at
    their normal check intervals (3 minutes, 5 minutes, etc...), but the won't actually be executed. This rescheduling loop will just
    continue all the while Icinga is running. We'll explain why this is done in a bit...</p>

    <p>That's it! Easy, huh?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.9. Problems With Passive Checks">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="problemspassive"></a>7.6.9. Problems With Passive Checks</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>For all intents and purposes we can say that the central server is relying solely on passive checks for monitoring. The main
    problem with relying completely on passive checks for monitoring is the fact that Icinga must rely on something else to provide
    the monitoring data. What if the remote host that is sending in passive check results goes down or becomes unreachable? If Icinga
    isn't actively checking the services on the host, how will it know that there is a problem?</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there is a way we can handle these types of problems...</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.10. Freshness Checking">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="freshnesschecks"></a>7.6.10. Freshness Checking</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>Icinga supports a feature that does "freshness" checking on the results of service checks. More information freshness
    checking can be found <a class="link" href="freshness.html" title="7.5. Service and Host Freshness Checks">here</a>. This features gives some protection against situations where remote hosts
    may stop sending passive service checks into the central monitoring server. The purpose of "freshness" checking is to ensure that
    service checks are either being provided passively by distributed servers on a regular basis or performed actively by the central server
    if the need arises. If the service check results provided by the distributed servers get "stale", Icinga can be configured to
    force active checks of the service from the central monitoring host.</p>

    <p>So how do you do this? On the central monitoring server you need to configure services that are being monitoring by distributed
    servers as follows...</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>check_freshness</em></span> option in the service definitions should be set to 1. This enables "freshness"
        checking for the services.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>freshness_threshold</em></span> option in the service definitions should be set to a value (in seconds) which
        reflects how "fresh" the results for the services (provided by the distributed servers) should be.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>check_command</em></span> option in the service definitions should reflect valid commands that can be used to
        actively check the service from the central monitoring server.</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>

    <p>Icinga periodically checks the "freshness" of the results for all services that have freshness checking enabled. The
    <span class="emphasis"><em>freshness_threshold</em></span> option in each service definition is used to determine how "fresh" the results for each service
    should be. For example, if you set this value to 300 for one of your services, Icinga will consider the service results to be
    "stale" if they're older than 5 minutes (300 seconds). If you do not specify a value for the <span class="emphasis"><em>freshness_threshold</em></span>
    option, Icinga will automatically calculate a "freshness" threshold by looking at either the <span class="emphasis"><em>check_interval</em></span>
    or <span class="emphasis"><em>retry_interval</em></span> options (depending on what <a class="link" href="statetypes.html" title="5.8. State Types">type of state</a> the service is in). If
    the service results are found to be "stale", Icinga will run the service check command specified by the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>check_command</em></span> option in the service definition, thereby actively checking the service.</p>

    <p>Remember that you have to specify a <span class="emphasis"><em>check_command</em></span> option in the service definitions that can be used to
    actively check the status of the service from the central monitoring server. Under normal circumstances, this check command is never
    executed (because active checks were disabled on a program-wide basis or for the specific services). When freshness checking is enabled,
    Icinga will run this command to actively check the status of the service <span class="emphasis"><em>even if active checks are disabled on a
    program-wide or service-specific basis</em></span>.</p>

    <p>If you are unable to define commands to actively check a service from the central monitoring host (or if turns out to be a major
    pain), you could simply define all your services with the <span class="emphasis"><em>check_command</em></span> option set to run a dummy script that
    returns a critical status. Here's an example... Let's assume you define a command called 'service-is-stale' and use that command name in
    the <span class="emphasis"><em>check_command</em></span> option of your services. Here's what the definition would look like...</p>

    <pre class="programlisting"> define command{ 
     command_name service-is-stale 
     command_line /usr/local/icinga/libexec/check_dummy 2 "CRITICAL: Service results are stale"
 }</pre>

    <p>When Icinga detects that the service results are stale and runs the <span class="bold"><strong>service-is-stale</strong></span>
    command, the <span class="emphasis"><em>check_dummy</em></span> plugin is executed and the service will go into a critical state. This would likely cause
    notifications to be sent out, so you'll know that there's a problem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" title="7.6.11. Performing Host Checks">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="hostcheckperforming"></a>7.6.11. Performing Host Checks</h3></div></div></div>
    

    <p>At this point you know how to obtain service check results passivly from distributed servers. This means that the central server
    is not actively checking services on its own. But what about host checks? You still need to do them, so how?</p>

    <p>Since host checks usually compromise a small part of monitoring activity (they aren't done unless absolutely necessary), we'd
    recommend that you perform host checks actively from the central server. That means that you define host checks on the central server
    the same way that you do on the distributed servers (and the same way you would in a normal, non-distributed setup).</p>

    <p>Passive host checks are available (read <a class="link" href="passivechecks.html" title="5.7. Passive Checks">here</a>), so you could use them in your distributed
    monitoring setup, but they suffer from a few problems. The biggest problem is that Icinga does not translate passive host check
    problem states (DOWN and UNREACHABLE) when they are processed. This means that if your monitoring servers have a different parent/child
    host structure (and they will, if you monitoring servers are in different locations), the central monitoring server will have an
    inaccurate view of host states.</p>

    <p>If you do want to send passive host checks to a central server in your distributed monitoring setup, make sure:</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The central server has <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-accept_passive_host_checks">passive host checks</a> enabled
        (required)</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The distributed server is configured to <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-obsess_over_hosts">obsess over hosts</a>.</p>
<div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png"></td>
<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">
            <p>Although "obsess_over_host" is enabled per default in the object definition it may have been <span class="emphasis"><em>dis</em></span>abled
            via a template so make please sure to <span class="emphasis"><em>en</em></span>able it where you need it.</p>
          </td></tr>
</table></div>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p>The distributed server has an <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-ochp_command">ochp command</a> defined.</p>
      </li>
</ul></div>

    <p>The ochp command, which is used for processing host check results, works in a similiar manner to the ocsp command, which is used
    for processing service check results (see documentation above). In order to make sure passive host check results are up to date, you'll
    want to enable <a class="link" href="freshness.html" title="7.5. Service and Host Freshness Checks">freshness checking</a> for hosts (similiar to what is described above for services).</p>
