# CGI.CFG - CGI Configuration File for Icinga
#
#################################################################



######################################
#
#    COMMON (ALL CGIs)
#
######################################

# MAIN CONFIGURATION FILE
# This tells the CGIs where to find your main configuration file.
# The CGIs will read the main and host config files for any other
# data they might need.

main_config_file=@sysconfdir@/icinga.cfg



# STANDALONE INSTALLATION
# This is only useful in an Icinga 2 setup (or any other setup
# containing multiple Classic UI installs). If you have installed
# Icinga 2 with compat layer and classic-ui, you can set this
# to 1. Otherwise leave it at 0.
# Enabling this option ignores main_config_file setting.
#
# NOTE: Check also the "Standalone (Icinga2) section" at the bottom
# if this option is switched on!

standalone_installation=@CLASSICUI_STANDALONE_FLAG@



# PHYSICAL HTML PATH
# This is the path where the HTML files for Icinga reside.  This
# value is used to locate the logo images needed by the statusmap
# and status CGIs.

physical_html_path=@datadir@



# URL HTML PATH
# This is the path portion of the URL that corresponds to the
# physical location of the Icinga HTML files (as defined above).
# This value is used by the CGIs to locate the online documentation
# and graphics.  If you access the Icinga pages with an URL like
# http://www.myhost.com/icinga, this value should be '/icinga'
# (without the quotes).

url_html_path=@htmurl@



# URL STYLESHEETS PATH
# This option allows to define an url stylesheet path other than the
# default ($url_html_path/stylesheets). This will be useful when
# adding custom stylesheets in another location.
# If not set, the default location will be used.

url_stylesheets_path=@htmurl@/stylesheets



# HTTP CHARSET
# This defines charset that is sent with HTTP headers.

http_charset=utf-8



# REFRESH RATE
# This option allows you to specify the refresh rate in seconds
# of various CGIs (extinfo, outages, status, statusmap and tac).

refresh_rate=90



# REFRESH TYPE
# This option determines what type of refresh should be used.
# You can choose between http header and javascript. By
# default javascript (1) is activated. If you have trouble
# using javascript then try refresh via http header (0).

refresh_type=1



# ESCAPE HTML TAGS
# This option determines whether HTML tags in host and service
# status output is escaped in the web interface.  If enabled,
# your plugin output will not be able to contain clickable links.

escape_html_tags=1



# RESULT LIMIT
# This options specifies the number of page entries
# displayed by default in various cgi's. To display
# all entries by default set this value to 0.
# Default is 50.

result_limit=50



# SHOW TAC INFORMATION IN TOP FRAME
# This options places tactical overview information in
# the top frame similar to the view that's in icinga-web.
# By default it is enabled.

show_tac_header=1



# PENDING STATES OPTION
# This option determines what states should be displayed in the web
# interface for hosts/services that have not yet been checked.
# Values: 0 = leave hosts/services that have not been check yet in their original state
#         1 = mark hosts/services that have not been checked yet as PENDING (default)

use_pending_states=1



# FIRST DAY OF WEEK
# Here you can set if your week starts on sunday or monday.
# Default is 0 (Sunday), set it to 1 if your week start monday.

first_day_of_week=0



# CSV DELIMITER
# This option determines the character which should act as
# delimiter. Default is ";".

#csv_delimiter=;



# CSV DATA ENCLOSURE
# This option determines the character which should act as
# data enclosure to wrap in the data. Default is "'".

#csv_data_enclosure='



# SUPPRESS MAINTENANCE DOWNTIME
# This options suppresses the state coloring of hosts and services
# that are in a scheduled downtime. It sets their coloring to gray,
# so they no longer draw extra attention to themselves, making it
# so only actual problems are the ones that stand out.
# By default it is disabled.

suppress_maintenance_downtime=0



# URL TARGET FRAMES
# These options determine the target frames in which notes and
# action URLs will open. Default is main frame.

######################################
#
#   AUTHENTICATION (ALL CGIs)
#
######################################

# AUTHENTICATION USAGE
# This option controls whether or not the CGIs will use any
# authentication when displaying host and service information, as
# well as committing commands to Icinga for processing.
#
# Read the HTML documentation to learn how the authorization works!
#
# NOTE: It is a really *bad* idea to disable authorization, unless
# you plan on removing the command CGI (cmd.cgi)!  Failure to do
# so will leave you wide open to kiddies messing with Icinga and
# possibly hitting you with a denial of service attack by filling up
# your drive by continuously writing to your command file!
#
# Setting this value to 0 will cause the CGIs to *not* use
# authentication (bad idea), while any other value will make them
# use the authentication functions (the default).

use_authentication=1



# USE CLIENT CERTIFICATTES
# This option controls whether the value of the web server environment
# variable REMOTE_USER or SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN will be used. The name of
# the directive is a bit misleading because unless you set up the use
# of client certificates the value has to be set to zero (0). Setting
# the value to one (1) requires "SSLUserName SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN" and
# several other options in your web server config. Please consult your
# web server configuration documentation for details.
# 
# Values:
# 0 = Use web server environment variable REMOTE_USER to get the user
#	logged in. Don't use client certificates (default)
# 1 = Use web server environment variable SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN to get
#	the user logged in. Use client certificates

use_ssl_authentication=0



# LOWERCASE USER NAME
# This option controls whether or not the username is converted
# to all lowercase letters. Can be useful if the username is stored
# in Active Directory (case-insensitive).

lowercase_user_name=0



# DEFAULT USER
# Setting this variable will define a default user name that can
# access pages without authentication.  This allows people within a
# secure domain (i.e., behind a firewall) to see the current status
# without authenticating.  You may want to use this to avoid basic
# authentication if you are not using a secure server since basic
# authentication transmits passwords in the clear.
#
# Important:  Do not define a default username unless you are
# running a secure web server and are sure that everyone who has
# access to the CGIs has been authenticated in some manner!  If you
# define this variable, anyone who has not authenticated to the web
# server will inherit all rights you assign to this user!

#default_user_name=guest



# SYSTEM/PROCESS INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# have access to viewing the Icinga process information as
# provided by the Extended Information CGI (extinfo.cgi).  By
# default, *no one* has access to this unless you choose to
# not use authorization.  You may use an asterisk (*) to
# authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

authorized_for_system_information=icingaadmin
#authorized_contactgroup_for_system_information=



# CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can view ALL configuration information (hosts, commands, etc).
# By default, users can only view configuration information
# for the hosts and services they are contacts for. You may use
# an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has authenticated
# to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

authorized_for_configuration_information=icingaadmin
#authorized_contactgroup_for_configuration_information=



# RAW COMMANDLINE CONFIGURATION INFORMATION ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can view a command in config command expander as icinga would
# execute it. To resolve all MACROS it is necessary to allow
# read access to the web server for resource.cfg .
# CAUTION: $USERXX$ vars and custom vars can contain sensitive
# data.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too.

authorized_for_full_command_resolution=icingaadmin
#authorized_contactgroup_for_full_command_resolution=



# SYSTEM/PROCESS COMMAND ACCESS
# This option is a comma-delimited list of all usernames that
# can issue shutdown and restart commands to Icinga via the
# command CGI (cmd.cgi).  Users in this list can also change
# the program mode to active or standby. By default, *no one*
# has access to this unless you choose to not use authorization.
# You may use an asterisk (*) to authorize any user who has
# authenticated to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

authorized_for_system_commands=icingaadmin
#authorized_contactgroup_for_system_commands=



# GLOBAL HOST/SERVICE VIEW ACCESS
# These two options are comma-delimited lists of all usernames that
# can view information for all hosts and services that are being
# monitored.  By default, users can only view information
# for hosts or services that they are contacts for (unless you
# you choose to not use authorization). You may use an asterisk (*)
# to authorize any user who has authenticated to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too.
#
# NOTE: Users in authorized_for_all_hosts are also automatically
# authorised to view information for all services.

authorized_for_all_services=icingaadmin
authorized_for_all_hosts=icingaadmin
#authorized_contactgroup_for_all_services=

# GLOBAL HOST/SERVICE COMMAND ACCESS
# These two options are comma-delimited lists of all usernames that
# can issue host or service related commands via the command
# CGI (cmd.cgi) for all hosts and services that are being monitored.
# By default, users can only issue commands for hosts or services
# that they are contacts for (unless you you choose to not use
# authorization).  You may use an asterisk (*) to authorize any
# user who has authenticated to the web server.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too.

#authorized_contactgroup_for_all_service_commands=
#authorized_contactgroup_for_all_host_commands=



# READ-ONLY USERS
# A comma-delimited list of usernames that have read-only rights in
# the CGIs.  This will block any service or host commands normally shown
# on the extinfo CGI pages. It will also block comments and downtimes
# from being shown to read-only users.
# Alternatively you can specify contactgroups too, starting
# with Icinga 1.5.0

#authorized_for_read_only=user1,user2
#authorized_contactgroup_for_read_only=



# READ-ONLY FOR COMMENTS USERS
# A comma-delimited list of usernames that have rights to view comments in
# the CGIs. If user is defined as read-only and you add the same user to
# this options, then the user can still see comments. If user is NOT
# read-only then the options to delete comments in extinfo.cgi are not
# displayed as well.

#authorized_for_comments_read_only=user1,user2
#authorized_contactgroup_for_comments_read_only=



# READ-ONLY FOR DOWNTIMES USERS
# A comma-delimited list of usernames that have rights to view downtimes in
# the CGIs. If user is defined as read-only and you add the same user to
# this options, then the user can still see downtimes. If user is NOT
# read-only then the options to delete downtimes in extinfo.cgi are not
# displayed as well.

#authorized_for_downtimes_read_only=user1,user2
#authorized_contactgroup_for_downtimes_read_only=



# SHOW ALL SERVICES THE HOST IS AUTHORIZED FOR
# By default, a user can see all services on a host, if the user is
# authorized as contact for the host only. By disabling this option,
# the user must be an authorized contact for the service too in order
# to view it.
# Values: 0 - disabled, user must be authorized for services too
#         1 - enabled, user can view all services on authorized host

show_all_services_host_is_authorized_for=1



# SHOW PARTIAL HOSTGROUPS
# By default (meaning the directive is not present or disabled), a user
# only sees a hostgroup and the hosts within it if they are an authorised
# contact for all of the hosts of the group. The behaviour can be changed
# using the directive show_partial_hostgroups=1.
# When enabled, the hostgroups overview will show a partial listing of hosts
# that the user is an authorised contact for within each hostgroup.
# It will also add the string "(Partial Hostgroups Enabled)" to the top of
# the Hostgroup Overview to help prevent any confusion over whether the option
# is in use or not. However for privacy reasons, hostgroups that are only showing
# a partial listing are not specifically indicated.
# 
# COMPATIBILITY NOTICE: As with any tweak made to the output of the CGIs, enabling
# this option may adversely impact third party programs that rely on 'screen scraping'
# to get their information. If you encounter such a problem, turn this option back
# to its default of off and encourage the developer(s) of the program to use JSON
# for their data needs instead.
# 
# Values: 0 - disabled, user only sees full hostgroups (default)
#         1 - enabled, user sees partial hostgroups

show_partial_hostgroups=0

#
#   STATUSMAP (statusmap.cgi)
#
######################################

# STATUSMAP BACKGROUND IMAGE
# This option allows you to specify an image to be used as a background
# in the statusmap CGI if you use the user-supplied coordinates layout method.
# The background image is not be available in any other layout methods. It is
# assumed that the image resides in the HTML images path (i.e. 
# /usr/local/icinga/share/images). This path is automatically determined by
# appending "/images" to the path specified by the physical_html_path directive.
#
# NOTE: The image file can be in GIF, JPEG, PNG, or GD2 format. However, GD2
# format (preferably in uncompressed format) is recommended, as it will reduce
# the CPU load when the CGI generates the map image.

#statusmap_background_image=smbackground.gd2



# STATUSMAP TRANSPARENCY INDEX COLOR
# These options set the r,g,b values of the background color used the statusmap CGI,
# so normal browsers that can't show real png transparency set the desired color as
# a background color instead (to make it look pretty).
# Defaults to white: (R,G,B) = (255,255,255).

#color_transparency_index_r=255
#color_transparency_index_g=255
#color_transparency_index_b=255



# DEFAULT STATUSMAP LAYOUT METHOD
# This option allows you to specify the default layout method
# the statusmap CGI should use for drawing hosts.  If you do
# not use this option, the default is to use user-defined
# coordinates.  Valid options are as follows:
#	0 = User-defined coordinates
#	1 = Depth layers
#       2 = Collapsed tree
#       3 = Balanced tree
#       4 = Circular
#       5 = Circular (Marked Up)
#       6 = Baloon (Marked Up)

######################################

# SOUND OPTIONS
# These options allow you to specify an optional audio file
# that should be played in your browser window when there are
# problems on the network.  The audio files are used only in
# the status CGI.  Only the sound for the most critical problem
# will be played.  Order of importance (higher to lower) is as
# follows: unreachable hosts, down hosts, critical services,
# warning services, and unknown services. If there are no
# visible problems, the sound file optionally specified by
# 'normal_sound' variable will be played.
#
#
# &lt;varname&gt;lt;sound_file&gt;

# SERVICE STATES TO ANNOTATE WITH CURRENT NOTIFICATION NO.
# Set this to an OR of the service state identifiers for
# which status.cgi should not only report "Attempts" (e.g.,
# "3/3" for a HARD non-OK state with max_check_attempts=3)
# but also the current notification number ("(#0)" if no
# problem notification has been sent yet, etc.). This is
# helpful to identify services which switched between
# different non-OK states a lot, or services which have a
# first_notification_delay set and are "not yet officially"
# considered in trouble.
# Relevant values from include/statusdata.h (look them up
# *there* if you want to be *really* sure):
#	#define	SERVICE_PENDING		1
#	#define	SERVICE_OK		2
#	#define	SERVICE_WARNING		4
#	#define	SERVICE_UNKNOWN		8
#	#define	SERVICE_CRITICAL	16
# You'll likely want to use add_notif_num_hard=0 (default)

######################################

# OBJECT CACHE FILE
# This option determines where object definitions are cached when
# Icinga starts/restarts. The CGIs read object definitions from
# this cache file (rather than looking at the object config files
# directly) in order to prevent inconsistencies that can occur
# when the config files are modified after Icinga starts.
# Icinga 2 provides this file through its compat component, if enabled.

# restarts.
# Icinga 2 provides this file through its compat component, if enabled.

status_file=@STATEDIR@/status.dat



# RESOURCE FILE
# This is an optional resource file that contains $USERx$ macro
# definitions. Multiple resource files can be specified by using
# multiple resource_file definitions.  The CGIs will not attempt to
# read the contents of resource files, so information that is
# considered to be sensitive (usernames, passwords, etc) can be
# defined as macros in this file and restrictive permissions (600)
# can be placed on this file.

resource_file=@sysconfdir@/resource.cfg



# EXTERNAL COMMAND FILE
# This is the file that Icinga checks for external command requests.
# It is also where the command CGI will write commands that are submitted
# by users, so it must be writeable by the user that the web server
# is running as (usually 'nobody').  Permissions should be set at the
# directory level instead of on the file, as the file is deleted every
# time its contents are processed.

# EXTERNAL COMMAND OPTION
# This option allows you to specify whether or not Icinga should check
# for external commands (in the command file defined below).  By default
# Icinga will *not* check for external commands, just to be on the
# cautious side.  If you want to be able to use the CGI command interface
# you will have to enable this.
# Values: 0 = disable commands, 1 = enable commands

check_external_commands=1



# INTERVAL LENGTH
# This is the seconds per unit interval as used in the
# host/contact/service configuration files.  Setting this to 60 means
# that each interval is one minute long (60 seconds).  Other settings
# have not been tested much, so your mileage is likely to vary...

interval_length=60



# STATUS FILE UPDATE INTERVAL
# This option determines the frequency (in seconds) that
# Icinga will periodically dump program, host, and
# service status data.
# Increase the value, if you don't require it that often.

#status_update_interval=30
status_update_interval=10



# LOG FILE
# This is the main log file where service and host events are logged
# for historical purposes.  This should be the first option specified
# in the config file!!!
# Icinga 2 provides this file through its compat component, if enabled.

log_file=@LOGDIR@/icinga.log



# LOG ROTATION METHOD
# This is the log rotation method that Icinga should use to rotate
# the main log file. Values are as follows..
#	n	= None - don't rotate the log
#	h	= Hourly rotation (top of the hour)
#	d	= Daily rotation (midnight every day)
#	w	= Weekly rotation (midnight on Saturday evening)
#	m	= Monthly rotation (midnight last day of month)

log_rotation_method=d



# LOG ARCHIVE PATH
# This is the directory where archived (rotated) log files should be
# placed (assuming you've chosen to do log rotation).
# Icinga 2 provides this file through its compat component, if enabled.

log_archive_path=@LOGDIR@/archives



# DATE FORMAT OPTION
# This option determines how short dates are displayed. Valid options
# include:
#	us		(MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
#	euro    	(DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
#	iso8601		(YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
#	strict-iso8601	(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
