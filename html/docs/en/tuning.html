    <p>So you've finally got Icinga up and running and you want to know how you can tweak it a bit. Tuning Icinga to
    increase performance can be necessary when you start monitoring a large number (&gt; 1,000) of hosts and services. Here are a few things
    to look at for optimizing Icinga...</p>

<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Graph performance statistics with PNP4Nagios</strong></span> . In order to keep track of how well your
        Icinga installation handles load over time and how your configuration changes affect it, you should be graphing several
        important statistics with PNP4Nagios. This is really, really, really useful when it comes to tuning the performance of a
        Icinga installation. Really. Information on how to do this can be found <a class="link" href="perfgraphs.html" title="8.7. Graphing Performance Info With PNP4Nagios">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use large installation tweaks</strong></span> . Enabling the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-use_large_installation_tweaks">use_large_installation_tweaks</a> option may provide you with better
        performance. Read more about what this option does <a class="link" href="largeinstalltweaks.html" title="8.5. Large Installation Tweaks">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Disable environment macros</strong></span> . Macros are normally made available to check, notification, event
        handler, etc. commands as environment variables. This can be a problem in a large Icinga installation, as it consumes some
        additional memory and (more importantly) more CPU. If your scripts don't need to access the macros as environment variables (e.g.
        you pass all necessary macros on the command line), you don't need this feature. You can prevent macros from being made available as
        environment variables by using the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-enable_environment_macros">enable_environment_macros</a>
        option.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Check Result Reaper Frequency</strong></span> . The <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-check_result_reaper_frequency">check_result_reaper_frequency</a> variable determines how often Icinga
        should check for host and service check results that need to be processed. The maximum amount of time it can spend processing those
        results is determined by the max reaper time (see below). If your reaper frequency is too high (too infrequent), you might see high
        latencies for host and service checks.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Max Reaper Time</strong></span> . The <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-max_check_result_reaper_time">max_check_result_reaper_time</a> variables determines the maximum amount of
        time the Icinga daemon can spend processing the results of host and service checks before moving on to other things - like
        executing new host and service checks. Too high of a value can result in large latencies for your host and service checks. Too low
        of a value can have the same effect. If you're experiencing high latencies, adjust this variable and see what effect it has. Again,
        you should be <a class="link" href="perfgraphs.html" title="8.7. Graphing Performance Info With PNP4Nagios">graphing statistics</a> in order to make this determination.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Adjust buffer slots</strong></span> . You may need to adjust the value of the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-external_command_buffer_slots">external_command_buffer_slots</a> option. Graphing buffer slot statistics with
        <a class="link" href="perfgraphs.html" title="8.7. Graphing Performance Info With PNP4Nagios">PNP4Nagios</a> (see above) is critical in determining what values you should use for this
        option.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Check service latencies to determine best value for maximum concurrent checks</strong></span> . Icinga
        can restrict the number of maximum concurrently executing service checks to the value you specify with the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-max_concurrent_checks">max_concurrent_checks</a> option. This is good because it gives you some control over
        how much load Icinga will impose on your monitoring host, but it can also slow things down. If you are seeing high latency
        values (&gt; 10 or 15 seconds) for the majority of your service checks (via the <a class="link" href="cgis.html#cgis-extinfo_cgi">extinfo
        CGI</a>), you are probably starving Icinga of the checks it needs. That's not Icinga's fault - its yours. Under
        ideal conditions, all service checks would have a latency of 0, meaning they were executed at the exact time that they were
        scheduled to be executed. However, it is normal for some checks to have small latency values. We would recommend taking the minimum
        number of maximum concurrent checks reported when running Icinga with the <span class="bold"><strong>-s</strong></span> command line
        argument and doubling it. Keep increasing it until the average check latency for your services is fairly low. More information on
        service check scheduling can be found <a class="link" href="checkscheduling.html" title="7.23. Service and Host Check Scheduling">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use passive checks when possible</strong></span> . The overhead needed to process the results of <a class="link" href="passivechecks.html" title="5.7. Passive Checks">passive service checks</a> is much lower than that of "normal" active checks, so make use of that piece
        of info if you're monitoring a slew of services. It should be noted that passive service checks are only really useful if you have
        some external application doing some type of monitoring or reporting, so if you're having Icinga do all the work, this won't
        help things.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Avoid using interpreted plugins</strong></span> . One thing that will significantly reduce the load on your
        monitoring host is the use of compiled (C/C++, etc.) plugins rather than interpreted script (Perl, etc) plugins. While Perl scripts
        and such are easy to write and work well, the fact that they are compiled/interpreted at every execution instance can significantly
        increase the load on your monitoring host if you have a lot of service checks. If you want to use Perl plugins, consider compiling
        them into true executables using perlcc(1) (a utility which is part of the standard Perl distribution) or compiling Icinga
        with an embedded Perl interpreter (see below).</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use the embedded Perl interpreter</strong></span> . If you're using a lot of Perl scripts for service checks,
        etc., you will probably find that compiling the <a class="link" href="embeddedperl.html" title="7.18. Using The Embedded Perl Interpreter">embedded Perl interpreter</a> into the Icinga
        binary will speed things up.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Optimize host check commands</strong></span> . If you're checking host states using the check_ping plugin
        you'll find that host checks will be performed much faster if you break up the checks. Instead of specifying a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>max_attempts</em></span> value of 1 in the host definition and having the check_ping plugin send 10 ICMP packets to the
        host, it would be much faster to set the <span class="emphasis"><em>max_attempts</em></span> value to 10 and only send out 1 ICMP packet each time.
        This is due to the fact that Icinga can often determine the status of a host after executing the plugin once, so you want to
        make the first check as fast as possible. This method does have its pitfalls in some situations (i.e. hosts that are slow to respond
        may be assumed to be down), but you'll see faster host checks if you use it. Another option would be to use a faster plugin (i.e.
        check_fping) as the <span class="emphasis"><em>host_check_command</em></span> instead of check_ping.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Schedule regular host checks</strong></span> . Scheduling regular checks of hosts can actually help
        performance in Icinga. This is due to the way the <a class="link" href="cachedchecks.html" title="7.21. Cached Checks">cached check logic</a> works (see below).
        Host checks are run in parallel - just like service checks. To schedule regular checks of a host, set the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>check_interval</em></span> directive in the <a class="link" href="objectdefinitions.html#objectdefinitions-host">host definition</a> to something
        greater than 0.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Enable cached host checks</strong></span> . On-demand host checks can benefit from caching. On-demand host
        checks are performed whenever Icinga detects a service state change. These on-demand checks are executed because
        Icinga wants to know if the host associated with the service changed state. By enabling cached host checks, you can optimize
        performance. In some cases, Icinga may be able to used the old/cached state of the host, rather than actually executing a
        host check command. This can speed things up and reduce load on monitoring server. In order for cached checks to be effective, you
        need to schedule regular checks of your hosts (see above). More information on cached checks can be found <a class="link" href="cachedchecks.html" title="7.21. Cached Checks">here</a>.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Don't use agressive host checking</strong></span>. Unless you're having problems with Icinga
        recognizing host recoveries, We would recommend not enabling the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-use_agressive_host_checking">use_aggressive_host_checking</a> option. With this option turned off host checks
        will execute much faster, resulting in speedier processing of service check results. However, host recoveries can be missed under
        certain circumstances when this it turned off. For example, if a host recovers and all of the services associated with that host
        stay in non-OK states (and don't "wobble" between different non-OK states), Icinga may miss the fact that the host has
        recovered. A few people may need to enable this option, but the majority don't and we would recommend not using it unless you find
        it necessary...</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>External command optimizations</strong></span> . If you're processing a lot of external commands (i.e.
        passive checks in a <a class="link" href="distributed.html" title="7.6. Distributed Monitoring">distributed setup</a>, you'll probably want to set the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-command_check_interval">command_check_interval</a> variable to <span class="bold"><strong>-1</strong></span>. This will
        cause Icinga to check for external commands as often as possible. You should also consider increasing the number of available
        <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-external_command_buffer_slots">external command buffer slots</a>. Buffers slots are used to hold
        external commands that have been read from the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-command_file">external command file</a> (by a separate
        thread) before they are processed by the Icinga daemon. If your Icinga daemon is receiving a lot of passive checks or
        external commands, you could end up in a situation where the buffers are always full. This results in child processes (external
        scripts, NSCA daemon, etc.) blocking when they attempt to write to the external command file. We would highly recommend that you
        graph external command buffer slot usage using PNP4Nagios and the nagiostats utility as described <a class="link" href="perfgraphs.html" title="8.7. Graphing Performance Info With PNP4Nagios">here</a>, so you understand the typical external command buffer usage of your Icinga
        installation.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Optimize hardware for maximum performance</strong></span> . NOTE: Hardware performance shouldn't be an issue
        unless: 1) you're monitoring thousands of services, 2) you're doing a lot of post-processing of performance data, etc. Your system
        configuration and your hardware setup are going to directly affect how your operating system performs, so they'll affect how
        Icinga performs. The most common hardware optimization you can make is with your hard drives. CPU and memory speed are
        obviously factors that affect performance, but disk access is going to be your biggest bottleneck. Don't store plugins, the status
        log, etc on slow drives (i.e. old IDE drives or NFS mounts). If you've got them, use UltraSCSI drives or fast IDE drives. An
        important note for IDE/Linux users is that many Linux installations do not attempt to optimize disk access. If you don't change the
        disk access parameters (by using a utility like <span class="bold"><strong>hdparam</strong></span>), you'll loose out on a <span class="bold"><strong>lot</strong></span> of the speedy features of the new IDE drives.</p>
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use a RAM disk for temporary data</strong></span> . Several files are created and processed very often. That
        includes the current status stored in the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-status_file">status file</a> and the configuration being
        cached in the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-object_cache_file">object cache file</a>. To reduce physical I/O it is advisable to have
        this data on a RAM disk. Data loss due to a power failure or something alike is not critical because the two files are created every
        time Icinga is (re)started. Setting up the RAM disk and the changes to the main config file is described <a class="link" href="temp_data.html" title="8.8. Temporary Data">here</a>.</p>
