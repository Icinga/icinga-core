  <p>This is intended to be a brief overview of some things you should keep in mind when installing Icinga, so as set it
  up in a secure manner.</p>

  <p>Your monitoring box should be viewed as a backdoor into your other systems. In many cases, the Icinga server might
  be allowed access through firewalls in order to monitor remote servers. In most all cases, it is allowed to query those remote
  servers for various information. Monitoring servers are always given a certain level of trust in order to query remote systems.
  This presents a potential attacker with an attractive backdoor to your systems. An attacker might have an easier time getting
  into your other systems if they compromise the monitoring server first. This is particularly true if you are making use of
  shared SSH keys in order to monitor remote systems.</p>

  <p>If an intruder has the ability to submit check results or external commands to the Icinga daemon, they have the
  potential to submit bogus monitoring data, drive you nuts you with bogus notifications, or cause event handler scripts to be
  triggered. If you have event handler scripts that restart services, cycle power, etc. this could be particularly
  problematic.</p>

  <p>Another area of concern is the ability for intruders to sniff monitoring data (status information) as it comes across the
  wire. If communication channels are not encrypted, attackers can gain valuable information by watching your monitoring
  information. Take as an example the following situation: An attacker captures monitoring data on the wire over a period of time
  and analyzes the typical CPU and disk load usage of your systems, along with the number of users that are typically logged into
  them. The attacker is then able to determine the best time to compromise a system and use its resources (CPU, etc.) without
  being noticed.</p>

  <p>Here are some tips to help ensure that you keep your systems secure when implementing a Icinga-based monitoring
  solution...</p>

  <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use a Dedicated Monitoring Box</strong></span> . We would recommend that you install Icinga on
      a server that is dedicated to monitoring (and possibly other admin tasks). Protect your monitoring server as if it were one
      of the most important servers on your network. Keep running services to a minimum and lock down access to it via TCP
      wrappers, firewalls, etc. Since the Icinga server is allowed to talk to your servers and may be able to poke through
      your firewalls, allowing users access to your monitoring server can be a security risk. Remember, its always easier to gain
      root access through a system security hole if you have a local account on a box.</p>

      <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/security3.png"></span></p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Don't Run Icinga As Root</strong></span> . Icinga doesn't need to run as root, so don't
      do it. You can tell Icinga to drop privileges after startup and run as another user/group by using the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-icinga_user">icinga_user</a> and <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-icinga_group">icinga_group</a>
      directives in the main config file. If you need to execute event handlers or plugins which require root access, you might
      want to try using <a class="link" href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/sudo" target="_top">sudo</a>.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Lock Down The Check Result Directory</strong></span> . Make sure that only the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>icinga</em></span> user is able to read/write in the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-check_result_path">check result
      path</a>. If users other than <span class="emphasis"><em>icinga</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>root</em></span>) are able to write to this
      directory, they could send fake host/service check results to the Icinga daemon. This could result in annoyances
      (bogus notifications) or security problems (event handlers being kicked off).</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Lock Down The External Command File</strong></span> . If you enable <a class="link" href="extcommands.html" title="7.1. External Commands">external commands</a>, make sure you set proper permissions on the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>/usr/local/icinga/var/rw</em></span> directory. You only want the Icinga user (usually
      <span class="emphasis"><em>icinga</em></span>) and the web server user (usually <span class="emphasis"><em>nobody</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>httpd</em></span>,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>apache2</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>www-data</em></span>) to have permissions to write to the command file. If you've
      installed Icinga on a machine that is dedicated to monitoring and admin tasks and is not used for public accounts,
      that should be fine. If you've installed it on a public or multi-user machine (not recommended), allowing the web server
      user to have write access to the command file can be a security problem. After all, you don't want just any user on your
      system controlling Icinga through the external command file. In this case, we would suggest only granting write
      access on the command file to the <span class="emphasis"><em>icinga</em></span> user and using something like <a class="link" href="http://cgiwrap.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">CGIWrap</a> to run the CGIs as the <span class="emphasis"><em>icinga</em></span> user instead
      of <span class="emphasis"><em>nobody</em></span>.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Require Authentication In The CGIs</strong></span> . We would strongly suggest requiring
      authentication for accessing the CGIs. Once you do that, read the documentation on the default rights that authenticated
      contacts have, and only authorize specific contacts for additional rights as necessary. Instructions on setting up
      authentication and configuring authorization rights can be found <a class="link" href="cgiauth.html" title="6.2. Authentication And Authorization In The Classic UI">here</a>. If you disable the CGI
      authentication features using the <a class="link" href="configcgi.html#configcgi-use_authentication">use_authentication</a> directive in the
      CGI config file, the <a class="link" href="cgis.html#cgis-cmd_cgi">command CGI</a> will refuse to write any commands to the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-command_file">external command file</a>. After all, you don't want the world to be able to control
      Icinga do you?</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Implement Enhanced CGI Security Measures</strong></span> . We would strongly suggest that you
      consider implementing enhanced security measures for the CGIs as described <a class="link" href="cgisecurity.html" title="8.2. Enhanced Classic UI Security and Authentication">here</a>. These
      measures can help ensure that the username/password you use to access the Icinga web interface are not intercepted by
      third parties.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Use Full Paths In Command Definitions</strong></span> . When you define commands, make sure you
      specify the <span class="emphasis"><em>full path</em></span> (not a relative one) to any scripts or binaries you're executing.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Hide Sensitive Information With $USERn$ Macros</strong></span> . The CGIs read the <a class="link" href="configmain.html" title="3.2. Main Configuration File Options">main config file</a> and <a class="link" href="configobject.html" title="3.3. Object Configuration Overview">object config file(s)</a>, so you don't
      want to keep any sensitive information (usernames, passwords, etc) in there. If you need to specify a username and/or
      password in a command definition use a $USERn$ <a class="link" href="macros.html" title="5.2. Understanding Macros and How They Work">macro</a> to hide it. $USERn$ macros are defined in
      one or more <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-resource_file">resource files</a>. The CGIs will not attempt to read the contents
      of resource files, so you can set more restrictive permissions (600 or 660) on them. See the sample
      <span class="emphasis"><em>resource.cfg</em></span> file in the base of the Icinga distribution for an example of how to define $USERn$
      macros.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Strip Dangerous Characters From Macros</strong></span> . Use the <a class="link" href="configmain.html#configmain-illegal_macro_output_chars">illegal_macro_output_chars</a> directive to strip dangerous characters
      from the $HOSTOUTPUT$, $SERVICEOUTPUT$, $HOSTPERFDATA$, and $SERVICEPERFDATA$ macros before they're used in notifications,
      etc. Dangerous characters can be anything that might be interpreted by the shell, thereby opening a security hole. An
      example of this is the presence of backtick (`) characters in the $HOSTOUTPUT$, $SERVICEOUTPUT$, $HOSTPERFDATA$, and/or
      $SERVICEPERFDATA$ macros, which could allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary command as the icinga user (one good reason
      not to run Icinga as the root user).</p>

    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Secure Access to Remote Agents</strong></span> . Make sure you lock down access to agents (NRPE,
      NSClient, SNMP, etc.) on remote systems using firewalls, access lists, etc. You don't want everyone to be able to query your
      systems for status information. This information could be used by an attacker to execute remote event handler scripts or to
      determine the best times to go unnoticed.</p>
    </li>
<li class="listitem">
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Secure Communication Channels</strong></span> . Make sure you encrypt communication channels between
      different Icinga installations and between your Icinga servers and your monitoring agents whenever possible.
      You don't want someone to be able to sniff status information going across your network. This information could be used by
      an attacker to determine the best times to go unnoticed.</p>
